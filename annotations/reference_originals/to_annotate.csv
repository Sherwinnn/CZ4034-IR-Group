7678,Iro Iro Japanese Restaurant,5,"We were so excited to eat so the photos are taken when we were halfway in. We chanced upon this place after work nearby - We ordered 2 Tempura udon (which includes fried tempura ebi, salmon, pumpkin and some enoki mushroom), dragon boat maki and a yuzu sake. The udon was amazing, soup tasted really light but flavourful with the hint of the mushroom. Noodles were cooked to a good texture and the tempura was not too oily at all! It was really comforting on a cold rainy night. My partner seldom finishes soup in soup dishes but he DEMOLISHED the whole udon.

The dragon boat maki was amazing as well, the ebi was cooked so nicely (not too oily, flour was not too much) and the salmon on it was a great addition. Very well blended taste and honestly i‚Äôm still thinking about it üòãü§§

We initially wanted to order  highball to try, but the lady boss (I assume) recommended us a yuzu sake that she had just brought in. It turned out really good and went so well with the food we ordered! She got another glass of sake (which she additionally shared with us it‚Äôs of a higher tier that is also yuzu but sweeter) That one was ü§©ü§©ü§©‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I wanted to find out what brand/type was it but she was busy. (She offered as goodwill too cause another waiter accidentally spilled my glass while he was cleaning up, hope he didn‚Äôt get scolded too much for it!!! Hahaha)

We were also then served barley tea FOC - she mentioned it was refreshing after drinking alcohol and she was right. Commendable that she is very familiar with providing her customers the best experience there. Would recommend and definitely will come back again!! It‚Äôs just 3 mins walk from lorong chuan MRT exit B. Super convenient. I have also noticed there‚Äôs a lot of regular customers coming in. Not sure about the sashimi and chawamushi, but I will definitely try it again when i‚Äôm back. ü§©",2023-11-25T02:55:12.562Z,1,Lee Joleen,39.0,False,2023-12-10T15:15:19.003Z,,3 months ago,,Dinner,Plenty of parking,$30‚Äì40,Dine in,5.0,5.0,5.0,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsM2RmeWlnRRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOiD_WFp4Cny8ag4FehicxpYtgXU938fwkumuFo=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZ6mA_xTDmbph0cyqZ0sqROAIKLJgeb1OMWVR5=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2ZMkpI8VQDD0TmnyvgJmzSsPEOUlpiNrIMvBV=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcfCWn3lcP5WJ4YVfDhdNN-6x3eZbJHagqM8O8=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsM2RmeWlnRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x320e6897bc14220f!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICl3dfyigE%7CCgwIkMSFqwYQ4JqKjAI%7C?hl=en,117934328219292461664,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXItWf71jdchCG-WtfyKpl92nsy8dJf-DJCO0BFxzHDtRI=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117934328219292461664?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,338

5574,Pixy Restaurant & Bar,2,"Had a good dining experience about two to three years ago during the Covid period. Came back to Pixy for the second time for dinner.

We ordered three dishes - bouillabaisse, grilled iberico pork collar and grilled squid, squid ink risotto. In general, the taste of the dishes is decent but we had some issues with the freshness and texture of the ingredients.

The bouillabaisse consist of two pieces of cuttlefish tentacles, one scallop, two prawns, three pieces of mackerel and some clams. Some of the ingredients wasn‚Äôt fresh and we highlighted it to the chef. He claimed that the prawns were frozen. The taste was definitely not sweet (menu indicated that it‚Äôs sweet prawn) and was mushy. The clams tasted bland, overcooked and soft. This dish is a chef‚Äôs recommendation but I definitely wouldn‚Äôt recommend it.

The taste of the grilled iberico pork collar was nice but it was at least 50% fat. Have tasted many iberico pork collar before but never this fat. The accompanying sides were decent.

The grilled squid was nicely done. However the risotto‚Äôs in the grilled squid was like a paste.

Overall the ambiance and service was nice but all the three dishes were underwhelming. It‚Äôs also unusual that a restaurant of that size has only one chef and one server on a Saturday evening.",2024-01-07T05:36:13.209Z,0,Kenny Lau,17.0,True,,,2 months ago,,Dinner,,$40‚Äì50,Dine in,5.0,2.0,5.0,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQxcm9pZlFREAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_nbupfkO_R2deyoTtN7b-tM3YoflbgfRlTYS6=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFiTixpd5EMbXmqxjVW0y9z1FlcvVnFbLOd7-Y=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIaISk6_IKsbSlE7zi7_dubK3fZygY0vOCKaOh=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnBDwgpJekeacwKsNkdw1aXJyCCsVe6sb7C6Xl=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkkKYn86BvIrIYW77oq4rk2O9qDdHrsfzpQ7IY=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQuitrG-yYFOvDoxzKRUBM5MjAfvlJIviu7xsZ=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQxcm9pZlFREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xf227f44f0e381968!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID1roifQQ%7CCgsIzfDorAYQuKjyYw%7C?hl=en,108251596692692513324,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW4lAit49AW8C2GkSRsfp2spazQ9taVYrvyiLaorJve1LE=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108251596692692513324?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,221

Spinach soup is a total disappointment. It taste like salt water instead of the broth soup.  Spinach is old and hard to chew. Will not recommend the soup at all.

2669,Black Society ÈªëÁ§æ‰ºö,4,"Tried this place for the first time after reading some of the online reviews and checking out menu. As you can read from the multiple reviews here on Google, the food is good with a wide variety of items available. Unfortunately, they really struggle with the service element. In wanting to be specific, the general service was ok for me. Just 2 things really left a sour taste in my mouth after the delicious meal:

1. Communication: when ordering drinks, I had asked my server if plain water was chargeable. What I understood from him was that as long as the table purchased some form of drinks, e.g. tea, water would be complimentary. We thus believed this to be so until the bill came and the cashier said that I was misled and didn‚Äôt have the courtesy to waive the 3 cups of plain water we ordered.

2. Pushiness in ordering: as it was my first visit and not knowing the portioning of food in terms of small, medium and large dishes, I had to rely on the order-taker to guide me in terms of what was enough for our table. Unfortunately, even when I thought enough was ordered, she still tried to nudge me to order more and dessert as well. I drew the line before dessert and true enough when the food started coming, it was overwhelming. When we tried to cancel items that had not arrived, we were not allowed to. By the end of the meal, we had to takeaway 3 almost-untouched dishes to prevent wastage of food.

For first timers, do double or triple check if unsure about what is chargeable, and go with your gut instinct rather than just trusting the order-taker to order more than sufficient.",2023-11-13T10:32:43.429Z,3,Kevin Ang,1182.0,False,2023-11-17T01:22:08.695Z,,3 months ago,,Dinner,,$50‚Äì60,Dine in,4.0,5.0,3.0,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNseU5TNTFRRRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJBTN9Gs2VWF-FHPMr3X-4tafDt5DNH8QH2JCM=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPdeml22GtDfY81ZZscTDv6QUhapwKDafg0WURE=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4Ek00SymkLV6X32QUNlzGLFjQd3jbEiKc4LwF=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObqHbDTD5j2cILKE0S5JZnBbHaC2OhRcgi7r3O=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJ7YtNvcUpgiIvHaVvVIElD6qHyXgHngjZ_hXg=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3L-nWsSlCKlEhprCVEUPvKhGEqt8N075Y-V9D=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwnmpTEU4l8rD6vZ5ViZ62VS61s1LHgokw76dN=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKh-Ew-fp4y03Cr1k8HckKr8w0eIGv8SvfHhQ3=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOI-RPpiQZ56v0c7WnH0_PAmQXfA_ii_VFmABl0=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaWth0VJVV1i9RtoA0bpy4cIIG5g6jqE95vpVv=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOn-nNaL_PbWDJ2Q38y845BpodcJoz6emFQj4-h=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNt1m_r6UvHi1wS9UnOBAWrtCBjR6jIKHKJDyM=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9roE9Py4e4vlAUOTeljc7-pyvrMddxxqwikXC=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6l6llDHLCfQAJ8Oslz-hhjc0TgNhgdibCbR-D=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNseU5TNTFRRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xa966633b8edd7030!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIClyNS51QE%7CCgwIy_bHqgYQuJXhzAE%7C?hl=en,111247294128726535324,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUX0ZXuhYrTr87Mp20qWHDl6PCpr88GgZcTGaY0Mv1NheE=s120-c-rp-mo-ba7-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111247294128726535324?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,293

5633,Miyabi Japanese Restaurant,3,"Personally have never been a big fan of Raffles Town Club, especially with the ethical sagas that they have been put through in the past. Irregardless, find them very stuffy vs the newer Private Members Clubs in Singapore. Likewise, Miyabi, being the mainstay Japanese restaurant of Raffles Town Club, has this air of gloominess, age, and staleness the moment you walk in.

Coupled with the fact that only members can access the restaurant, there's automatically a discrimination towards a certain cluster of target audience.

It's probably good for family gatherings on the weekends, as you have private access to a teppanyaki space for yourselves. Prices are reasonable too, for the amount of food they serve as part of their teppanyaki sets. Get the lobster and beef set menu, and you should be sorted for the evening.

Food quality is good but not great. All else accounted for, I'm sure there are better Japanese restaurants around Singapore. This space reminds me of it being run like a passion project, not like a competitive f&b business in Singapore.

If you're looking for a space to chat and talk as a family dinner, this may not be for you, as you'll be sitting quite far away from each other, surrounding the teppanyaki hotplate.

9245,The Sapling Restaurant,4,"First time here. Made a Saturday lunch reservation which was confirmed via email by the Asst Mgr. Imagine my surprise when we arrived and was told that they do not have our reservation. Luckily, the place was empty except for us and another party.

We had menu 2. Food was tasty and comparable to similar items served in more atas cafes but at a discounted price. For soup, we were served with a chipped porcelain spoon. Please have the server check all cutlery before serving.

For the bakery located outside, it is advisable to have the payment and packing at the same location. The baked goods that I bought did not tally with the ones I received. They packed the baked goods behind the counter, bring it to the restaurant cashier for check-out. Customer will then procced to pay. There should be a verification step with customer to show them what was purchased.

Overall, I would return to try the dinner menu. Best of all, there's free parking on site.

7974,Hoy Yong Seafood Restaurant,1,"Ordered takeaway on a Sunday evening and waited one full hour despite placing our order at 625pm. The lady did warn us that the waiting time is 60mins before I placed our order so I guess that was somewhat fair.

However, none of the dishes was worth the hour‚Äôs wait. Food was very mediocre and super overpriced. The ten boxes in the photo was $184.

We had ordered Medium sized French Bean with Shrimp ($28!!!) and Medium Claypot tofu ($20+). There were barely any tofu and it was mostly gravy. The medium Prawn Paste Chicken was also $20+ for 9 pieces and the store didn‚Äôt have boxes with holes that allowed the hot steam from fried food to escape, so our wings were soggy and sad. The duck rolls which were supposedly a speciality at the shop was also odd tasting and didn‚Äôt really stand out for us.

Carbs wise, we got the medium egg Hor fun and medium crispy noodles. I don‚Äôt think there was much wokhey in the noodle dishes and it was pretty forgettable.

I would not recommend this place to anybody.

3065,Burger & Lobster Jewel Changi Airport,4,"Nice experience.

We had a long layover at the airport and treated ourselves to dinner to celebrate the end of our travelling journey.

Staff were super friendly and helpful. The view of the waterfall area was nice to view from where we were seated.

We got 2 rounds of cocktails and the sharing. Which we would recommend for those who are hungry! Worked out well for us. A whole lobster, a roll of your choice, burger of your choice and two sides of your choice.

Lobster was grilled and was nice but slightly lacking in that fresher flavour that I‚Äôve had other places.
They were also out of the chicken burger which we would‚Äôve liked to try.
Other patrons were a little bit rude, two people in T-shirts and younger seemed to annoy them. But we didn‚Äôt care that much. And the staff made us feel very welcome. Maybe seating a little further apart for the bar stools

Overall a nice experience for the food and drinks if you‚Äôre looking at spending some time in the airport area.",2023-05-10T13:07:46.905Z,0,Bethan Hannah,245.0,True,,,9 months ago,,Dinner,,$40‚Äì50,Dine in,,,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4LUt2TDJBRRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPdZNpv3ZzMFzqs1IfZIFu24mzvu4kOkRNZjLGf=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO32LL93soS1gAYLPu0zlv6d80lKgs7wy00VtDK=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORPAD9yvhjw47IzWBru4OBgZCJ90ZsglTj1n3j=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkfm4CmhS-frC_Bh3h30Ke0tQHZYK5sUHEz87s=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcHygo2uNKw2_0dpcJL-dXpsV-c0hg6MnkQbPZ=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvYhjstGA70aHPLahr2wr_84hpbBKz_fO3daiX=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPg8vk8sSeKWE2oDaYLJ-8Ne3SAYQbrSG9VKfdj=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4LUt2TDJBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xdabd35e8ea973e14!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICx-KvL2AE%7CCgwIoq7uogYQqIfnrwM%7C?hl=en,115838181974631302812,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV1noBVFak4lYeYSNUFOco03ChwFA-fku_LDYp_Eiwz0Jo=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115838181974631302812?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,178

We had a home lunch party for about 11 adults (7 non veg, 4 vegetarians) Ordered for a delivery through Tandoori Corner‚Äôs website. $347 incl delivery

The food arrived on time, still warm and well packed (briyanis were in plastic bentos and ala cartes were in individual plastic containers, naan wrapped in foil)

We took some poor pictures so can only post our delivery receipt to show our satisfaction. Everyone enjoyed the hearty and tasty meal and our party was a success! Thank you Surender and Tandoori Corner!!!!

Prev post Dec 2022
Been enjoying Tandoori Corner for years‚Ä¶ since I was an omnivore and have continued as a vegetarian. A long overdue review!

The menu is extensive, there is something for everyone.  Typically we come for dinner to enjoy the cool alfresco seating. We also used to cater with Tandoori Corner for our home parties and office functions (before covid) and everyone is happy.

But yesterday the lunch atmosphere was great too. We ordered the set lunches, generous portions for $10-12 each, add a drink for $1.

The tofu egg wasn't that nice.

The chawamushi was good but it had a layer of sauce that was sweet and sour which wasn't pleasant.

The crab sauce dumplings had too thick of a skin, and the fillings were not springy enough.

2582,March√© M√∂venpick VivoCity,4,"A non halal eatery. Have dined at marche for a good few times. All the while, they are well knowned for their rosti. Still one of the best after so many years. Crispy on the outside and soft inside. Pair well with the sour cream. Do expect to queue and wait for your turn and dish to be ready. Once you are at ordering counter..service is relatively fast. Menu clearly states what is available and TODAY'S SPECIAL. So, if you want to be served fast; think about what you want to order while in line before reaching ordering counter.

Dishes are generally made for 1 person portion. So maybe sharing is possible if you are in a group to taste relatively different food available.

Some food station practice ordering and wait for your food to be ready before collection using a buzzer such as pizza counter and pasta counter.

Dessert wise...only still can stomach in ice cream. LOVED IT!!!!!!!. very very nice, not too creamy.

3890,Le Jardin Restaurant,2,"Expensive food and small portion for brunch.
Drinks were pretty and tasted ok. Deco inside the cafe was beautiful.

We went with a dog and it rained really heavily.  When it was starting to rain, we asked the waitress for another place to dine, we were told there was no place we can finish our drinks inside the restaurant with a dog with us.
We tried to finish our drinks at the outdoor seats but the rain got heavy very fast.

We were only led to the patio by another waitress which is sheltered and at the side of the restaurant when my partner and I stand by the door of the restaurant due to the very heavy rain because the outdoor umbrella cannot shelter 4 people from the rain. We were drenched and standing there looking at the nice deco in the restaurant like the girl in the story of ""Little Match Girl"". Just nice that day was Christmas day.. So much feels.

7720,Jiang Ëî£ÂÖàÁîü Cantonese Asian Tapas,1,"$10.80 - XO carrot cake
$12.80 - octopus karaage
$11.80 - roast pork
$12.80 - braised pork belly with preserved vegetable
$15.80 - kailan 2 ways
$2 - plain rice
$3.50 - Thai iced tea
$2.50 - oolong tea

Our total bill for this place came up to $83.38, even after a card discount that took the signature carrot cake off the bill.

This place is incredibly overpriced. The place was empty when we went and the server seems nice enough, but the food ranged from average to bad.

The carrot cake was probably the best, but was average at best, like what you would get at dimsum places... Look at the size... That's 10.80++!

Octopus karaage was not crunchy and the portion was super small, while the sauce was like mayo, worse than sweechoon's kind of trashy sauce.

The kailan was just fried with floss on top... $15.80++! Are you kidding me?

The braised pork belly had so little pork that my friend had a piece each and I only had preserved vegetable. Just look at the pork in the picture... You can barely find any. $12.80 for preserved vegetable.

The winner is the ""Thai iced tea"" as it was described in the menu. It was clearly bottled tea.

It was not crowded at all which at first was slightly worrying to me, but after we tried the first dish that we ordered, the rest just kept getting better than the dish before! We had Cavatelli pasta with generous serving of squid, delicious carbonara cooked on a slab of cheese at the table, roasted octopus, and a shoulder of lamb that went excellently with toasted sourdough. The service was also fantastic, and Edward was very friendly and accommodating to our requests. It was a very satisfying and perfect slow lunch on a lazy Sunday afternoon.

While eating I noticed a pattern that is quite similar to Citrus by the pool and realized they both are the same company!
I loved the waffles and the portion of the ice cream was huge! I think the waiter gave me a different flavor instead of what I requested which I didn't even notice till my wife pointed it out! Guess I was too busy enjoying the waffle.
Their Cajun lamb chops need a slight improvement as it was a bit chewy but the flavour was good and the mashed potatoes were tasty!

2061,Azur,2,"The restaurant just reopened a week ago and it‚Äôs our first time at the buffet. The place was quite quiet, buffet spread is limited but have ample seats. The bbq pork ribs was the best dish among all. The Malaysia lok lok section have quite a lot of selection but they didn‚Äôt have a good deep fryer where the food wasn‚Äôt fried enough. So some came out uncooked and very oily inside. Hot coffee and tea is included in the buffet. Dessert was not good‚Ä¶ the worst would be the kueh pie tee. The look of it won‚Äôt make you wana try as the stew vege was so dry and burnt. The cups have a bad oil taste too.

2570,Tambi Restaurant,4,"Had a great meal at Tambi. Arrived at the restaurant on the dot and was showed to our seats. Looks pretty intimate dining at counter seats could see the chefs at work. A bit small but I believe there are bigger tables upstairs for bigger groups.
Asked the staff for recommendations and was given a few to decide. In the end since we were here we decided to order everything that was recommended.
Began with the starters, the Yellowtail Ssam which tasted interesting cooked Indian style and was complemented with the charred pineapple. Loved the pineapple which brought sweetness to the dish. The beef tartare was my most favourite in the starters which I believe should be ordered. If not the Oxtail bone marrow Murtabak should also be on the order list because it tasted so flavorful and richness of the oxtail.
Was given 2 recommendations for mains but we initially ordered one and then finally decided to get the other. First was the prawn  Maggie goreng, filled with wokhey you can see it as the chef was cooking and very fresh and giant prawn. Then we ordered and the 2nd main came which was the Australian wagyu bulgogi roti which I would say this would probably be the star of the night. So good and all the ingredients complemented each other so well the beef could just melt in the mouth.

Sashimi was fresh, and almost all cuts of meat tasted rich and creamy. The swordfish was the standout fish.

The Natsu bento set came with a variety of side dishes. Tha beef yakiniku was well seasoned and well cooked, and the garlic fried rice was fragrant and not too salty.

The beef yuzu sauteed is an interesting dish to try, being served with a yuzu sorbet at the side. The beef was nicely cooked, and eaten with the yuzu sorbet creates an interesting flavour and sensation, fusing sweet, sour, and savoury, and balancing warm and cold.

2500,NAEUM Restaurant,4,"Thank you for making my first omakase experience at your restaurant so special! It was a belated birthday celebration with my best friend, and the entire afternoon was truly memorable.

The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. When I realized I couldn't eat the beef in the ""SO BBQ"" dish (the description only mentioned hanging tenderloin), they quickly offered a delicious fish alternative without any hesitation. I truly appreciate their understanding and willingness to ensure I had a wonderful dining experience. Perhaps adding small icons to the menu indicating the type of meat in each dish would be helpful for future diners, especially those with allergies or preferences. For non-Korean speakers, adding translations or clearer description could improve understanding.

The food was fantastic overall, with a variety of creative and flavourful dishes. The sauces were flavorful, but perhaps a touch too strong for some of the dishes, slightly masking the delicate taste of the main ingredient. I also absolutely loved their kombucha and hope they consider selling it in batches in the future!

2316,Kailash Parbat Restaurant,2,"This feedback is especially only for Kailash Parbat Changi and I am a regular customer at KP Little India. I visited around 8.15 PM along with my friends family for Dinner for my daughter's birthday and we were total 13 pax. First of all, as usual food was amazing except MINI NAAN BOMB(it was in expired state which was shocking and unexpected for us but we just thought like it can happen sometime).. Now reason for giving 1 star for service, the service was extremely slow and no one was bothered to check back, we were keep calling them for the orders but it was very careless response always.. When we were placing one final order around 9.10 PM, person taking order immediately said as ""no more roti's(breads)"" is possible as we are closing now. Why I am surprised is because she didn't even listen as what I am about to order so it was very bad experience and I believe Kailash Parbat at Changi is good only for Buffets and not for Ala Carte as staff are very lazy and bit rude.. One last thing is our bill was 250+ so we were been informed that we can go for some complimentary or discount of 5% on bill but we were done with our food so we opted for discount which was not applied during payment and when I called & checked back with restaurant, response is that its customer's responsibility to inform during payment at counter as we cannot check with each customer during payment, its funny again as response was bit hard to listen. So guys plan accordingly at this outlet specifically  when planning for Ala Carte so that you don't get face disappointment.",2024-02-06T09:21:26.046Z,0,Nitesh Pareek,3.0,False,,,a month ago,,Dinner,,$30‚Äì40,Dine in,3.0,4.0,1.0,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWLTlHY1RBEAE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWLTlHY1RBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xf0aa01cf18d08bd6!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDV-9GcTA%7CCgsIlvSHrgYQ6OebFg%7C?hl=en,106601549824261476634,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLmY5r8j3_1gFvRkXnO1qUSYU0hDM7TnxUFd8KkyOJ3=s120-c-rp-mo-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106601549824261476634?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,287

7205,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,4,"Went for the buffet on a weekday evening.

This is our 3rd time eating. And each time the food standard has changed and dropped. Now for 45++ for dinner, it is quite a steep price. But u do get a good variety of food. Some hits some misses.

The abacus used to be awesome, but the last 2 visits were disappointing. The roast and bbq pork was good, standards maintained. Drunken prawns  good too. Chilli crab, lacked flavour but the crab quality was solid n meaty. Buddha jump over the wall was decent, with an abalone, black chicken, mushroom some cordecyp flowers and a tiny dried scallop. The kailan was quite salty. Spinach 3 egg was average. Orh nee dessert good altho i didn't fancy the coconut cream. Mango sago normal.

Staff was friendly and thoughtful. But then again we were the ONLY table that evening.

The buffet is a good option to try various options. Portions are standard zichar sizes and not small plates so if u go eat in a small group, you may not be able to try many dishes cos you'll be full early on.",2022-10-13T15:45:36.979Z,0,Vanessa Tay,63.0,False,,,a year ago,,Dinner,,,Dine in,4.0,3.0,4.0,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlcVp5dXF3RRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0u6W0suBbQfEHFW8k6CHLnGkGwrtwwA7sTxrz=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO768WGZGOjnkyKy4vq_4nUPgSQxZFX3WwPTsZ6=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlcVp5dXF3RRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x41afa224dc74e791!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDeqZyuqwE%7CCgwIoOWgmgYQwPP-0gM%7C?hl=en,103988477386126257243,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXjorIRyR_EDqVfcfxRC7PaNPHY9Fc2ZjhrUiLaLYP-IeM=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103988477386126257243?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,189

1514,eM By The Marina,2,"Mixed Experience (Visit Date 26 Jun 22)

It was great that:
1.Not crowded when we went at 6pm and got a cosy corner seat
2. Friendly servers
3. Casual environment
4. The food came fast
5. Quesadilla, Samosa, Aglio Olio were good

Disappointing:
1. Ordered sweet potato fries.  Got us  regular fries. They took it back. A gentleman came back to say they didn't have sweet potato. So we asked to give us regular ones. Then someone got us some soggy ones. The same ones they made by mistake for us earlier?
2. The lady seemed to get things a little mixed up. Messed up the fries and then just forgot we had ordered quesadillas.
3. Prices (of drinks that we got) at par or more than FOC Sentosa or Coastes.

7204,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,3,"Jubilee is a strange place indeed. A restaurant that's not really a proper restaurant per say. Looks like Safra wanted to maximise its rental income, so they simple compartmentalize the ball room into 4 sub dinning areas and leased them to Jubilee to operate as a restaurant! Good is that we booked 1 table and hv the whole sub dinning hall to ourselves. Bad is that next dinning room is hosting a D+D of sorts, so we had to put up loud noises as they had a karaoke competition for entertainment. Believe you me, wasn't that pleasant when you have to put up with extremely terrible loud voices screaming into the mike...not quite the SG got talent show!üò∞üò±

Foodwise, the quality is surprisely decent and not the usual mass produce type of food. Out of the 8 dishes on offer from the set CNY menu, I would say only the last 2 dishes....fried rice wrapped in lotus leaf n the red bean soup with glutinous rice balls are so so. The other dishes are good. Tasty and generous in portions. I liked the shark fins soup and stewed abalone with mushrooms especially! (Ok .... No disrespect to those anti shark fins activists...its just my personal choice). The prawn ball in oat flaks was also brilliant...piping hot, fresh n crunchy. The fish was humongous! Also quite fresh so would have been good if it was simply steamed instead of cooked with bean paste sauce. Still good nevertheless.

4 stars for food and 3 stars for the 'loud' ambience. 3.5 stars average. Perhaps good to visit the main branch in Katong.",2018-02-02T17:16:27.904Z,1,W.M.

The schezwan fried rice was full of added color. Pathetic flavour profile.

Had ordered paneer tikka masala few days before (pic not attached) , the color added stayed on the fingertips till the next day.

This restaurant is using way too much color in the food hence the pics look delicious. Perfect case of ""Don't judge the book by it's cover""!

643,Esarn Thai Corner Pasir Panjang,5,"Tucked away in a corner of Pasir Panjang, this
cosy restaurant should be familiar to the folks working at Mapletree Business City as it is along a row of eateries just 10 min away by foot.
The cuisine and staff here are authentic Thai, attracting a diverse clientele here for its good food. At my visit, I spotted an Indian family as well as a group of locals with their Caucasian companion.
The food is redolent with the spices of Thailand, imparting that flavor that tells you, if you close your eyes, that you are in a little part of the Land of Smiles, despite knowing otherwise. No doubt, the chatter in pasa Thai adds to the illusion.
Portion wise, the food is served in hearty quantities and speedily.
We could not eat fast enough - the food was that tasty.

4012,Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ,4,"We ordered 2 sets of Japanese Wagyu beef and 1 set of Australia Wagyu lunch set. The Japanese set was better than the Australian set due to the thickness and marbling of each piece of wagyu meat. I think the $12 differences is worth it.

The usage of charcoal grill was a plus point as it provided the immense heat and smoke that had added the charbroiled, smoky taste into the food that gives barbecued meats their unforgettable flavor.

Occasionally, the sudden blazing fire from the charcoal added the extra fun experience.

1309,Shake Shack Junction 8,5,"Dinner Gathering with my friends. First time eating at a Shake Shack outlet (I kid you not üòä). Suakoo me have tried Shake Shack Burgers, but it‚Äôs the tapao version by hubs.

Ordering from the Self Service Kiosk was easy except for the part where I had to verify myself (cos I ordered ShackMeister Ale & Shake Shack needed to ensure I‚Äôm not under 18 üòâ)

Asked for help from counter staff who then gave me the passcode. I tried a few times n failed. Asked the same counter staff again who quickly came over to help me with the passcode.

Seems that different outlets have different passcodes, and he has just transferred from another outlet. He apologised for this, but I told him it‚Äôs ok.

I found the whole experience very interesting, albeit a bit time consuming. I initially punched in my age cos I thought that‚Äôs what they needed üòÇ

Ordered Shack Stack (Mushrooms & Beef Burger). It was really delicious! The ale was pretty refreshing too.

It was full house when I was there at 7.15pm. I wish I have gone upstairs. Cos after reading the reviews here, upstairs has nicer environment.

Shake Shack served complimentary water (self service) at a counter where you find serviettes and condiments. One also return the trays at the same counter.

I‚Äôm impressed that the service staff cleared the trays pretty fast.

Would I visit this Bishan Junction 8 outlet again? Probably if I‚Äôm in the area again.

In the small bowl, there was only 1 tiny slice of Chinese mushroom & 2 very thin slices of Chinese sausage. No garnishes at all inside. Maybe kitchen was too busy to add them? Rice was very plain without any fragrance. Told the male waiter that chef should give more ingredients and he replied that all were portioned out. Told him that was why should portion put more! Ate half of the small bowl only because rice was not nice at all. After 2 hours of the dinner I was very hungry that I got to eat the tarts they gave. Tart was a great idea and they were not bad.

7279,Samy's Curry Restaurant,5,"Samy‚Äôs curry house is indeed a local legend! The pappadums are crispy, but also a bit thicker than normal, giving good texture. For me, they‚Äôre best enjoyed crushed and scattered liberally over the mildly fragrant biryani, which won‚Äôt overpower the other flavors on the plate. The best thing on the menu, though, is easily the fish curry. A masterpiece of fusion cooking - an Indian curry bubbling away in a Chinese clay pot - its flesh is fresh, firm and clean tasting, but nevertheless permeated completely with the fragrance of spice. As some would say, all the curries here ‚Äúgot power one!‚Äù and your tongue will thank you after the burn!

As for the atmosphere, it‚Äôs cheap and cheerful; a casual eatery with friendly, attentive service. Not exactly the place for candle-lit dinners, but perhaps where you go with your buddies after a long business meeting for a couple of pitchers of amazing lime juice or cold beers.

9393,Neon Pigeon,4,"The last time I visited Neon, it was more than a year ago, and I remembered being disappointed at the quality and pricing of the food.

This time, I was pleasantly surprised because it does feel like they have found the rhythm back in their stride. The food was lovely, and the cocktails, even classic ones that we ordered, were on point.

The tapas generally were very well balanced in terms of taste. The outstanding dish of the night was the amaebi served with wasabi tobiko on top of a crispy piece of chicken skin. The combination was sublime, with the freshness and sweetness of the shrimp complimenting that oily satisfying note from the chix skin.

The hamachi sashimi was fresh, served over ponzu. The bone marrow with uni was done really well, served with decadent brioche, and just the right amount of savory and sweetness. I usually worry if the uni is fresh but the uni quality was exceptional.

The duck foie gras dumplings were yunmy, only complaint is that I can‚Äôt really taste the foie, but still a satisfying dish.

The chilean seabass was perfectly cooked with bits of crispy garlic, and overall a perfect ending to the meal.

They make a really mean campari sour, and their old fashioneds weren‚Äôt shabby as well.

2509,NAEUM Restaurant,5,"Today, we dined at NAE:UM and ordered the classic menu of Episode 5 with both half wine pairing and non-alcoholic pairing. I must say that everything from the service, taste, to presentation was impeccable. My favorite dish of the night was the BBQ beef dish, which was extremely juicy and flavorful. It is probably one of the best beef dishes I have had in Singapore.

What impressed me the most was the amount of thought put into pairing each drink with each dish. The pairings complemented each other perfectly. One of the staff members highly praised one of the pairing wine, Joseph Faively, and that it is his favorite wine, and I could very much see why it was his favorite.

As a cherry on top, the staff left us alone after serving us the celebration cake, which was a great touch as my companion and I enjoyed being able to enjoy our own space. The only criticism we have is that the sparkling Jasmine tea was a bit rough on the throat and not to my taste.

Overall, I came in with high expectations for NAE:UM and left very impressed with the experience.",2023-04-04T14:16:55.887Z,1,JW,16.0,True,,,11 months ago,,Dinner,,$100+,Dine in,5.0,5.0,5.0,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc2JtS1VnEAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2Tq611i1wBRXVArI7yquan_8e9lBVIsv1zhDt=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOoJwpJxwc5kUm_Zbk1fEAdhAAuiHso3GhXyDh7=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWd5hzG075nau3mDzmaftDkhnfu81Bi2qzydQI=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5VqJvnvo4uLNbTiiVS63VvgXzcpxv-jTY7Zwy=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLgVx6fsjp0aQmCGt3_Lf7N2PV8gITrLFOVE5j=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYS1p0ACNX1IUAY1naCmCXAl1u9vGkfocfU3am=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM55dtMYoi_vA3EojoP5n8Yf2UqTSje_0Q8FlZp=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSxpCPbDl7KCox7vNSHi2IsE5lobN9OTkxsDyS=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6lBcqNxp5M6jvw7Y74uAHOiJXUAKy2tBKKnHl=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrgvRG1SmpfSbJ2cRWy00y9zjIlO4peqO5leo7=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZnY9lS8YYVp0HiOkIO2Ct_E1HlQ3VdsbhJKFr=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc2JtS1VnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x545f5c292d13e6f5!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICRsbmKUg%7CCgwI1-KwoQYQ0LqypwM%7C?hl=en,101194815918501076604,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUf0oRxhMYkZr67-99xXmrn6xPuWn6ReHYIRRFcAel-Y8I=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101194815918501076604?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,194

4394,Old Lai Huat Seafood Restaurant,3,Found this place after many years! But I must admit that I was a little disappointed. The fried balacan fish was still very good. Crispy & flavourful. Just don't look at the oil :p. Crispy baby squid was the best dish of the night. Black pepper crayfish was üòî. It's dry & quite tasteless. Deep fried fritters was expected. The rest of the dishes we ordered were nothing spectacular. Perhaps I was expecting a lot more as it was one of my favourite Tze char places many years back when they were still at Kallang. Do make a reservation if you are planning to visit. It's very popular with limited seating.,2022-05-03T12:07:46.315Z,3,Vtigaa Vtigaa,91.0,False,,,a year ago,,,,,,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyb083cFd3EAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJVw9K3Xn445wmv6fmR2Sc35Wc0v_mnHdnN5RY=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXVKhwkHoNGhT4M89j9NlKBNdi7MHNit5zI_fc=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFC1txDjekf_1xcNewUQQpKQBCD807S_e5CV8C=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyb083cFd3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xedc965ede1e7b13e!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID2oO7pWw%7CCgwIkrbEkwYQgMrDlgE%7C?hl=en,115070912373537254001,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUuoAqDHtgyrw8LIERT9Ik4Go-Ec7UG7ONYFdueBJ6kpA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115070912373537254001?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,111

1789,Ho√†ng H√¢u Vietnamese Restaurant,5,"Was looking for good food near SGH and found this place by chance. Would highly recommend to come here for a homely Vietnamese food. Below are my unbiased review:

The Lemongrass chicken skewers are really tasty, juicy and tender. The portion is also big.

Eel porridge is special and taste really nice and comfy especially in a rainy day.

Chicken Pho has a light broth that still encompass all the flavours. So if you prefer stronger taste, you might find it bland.

Fresh spring roll is fresh and good too, big in size! The sauce that comes with the spring roll is also unique and tasty.

Pork Bun Cha is a flavourful fish with fresh vegetables, sauce that is light with a tinge of sour, coupled with the pork meat patty that‚Äôs well flavoured (but a little hard for my taste).

The prawn crackers has light prawn taste and not oily, those who prefer lighter prawn taste will like this one.

For drinks, Vietnam coffee is a little light; the lemon grass is nice but is sweeten.

Service is very homely and they are Vietnamese who speaks chinese.

Would be back again for sure!

3483,White Restaurant (Tampines Mall),4,"Relatively new kid on the block. Decided to give it a try and I think one of the bosses was very friendly and courteous to the diners and was really making sure the diners enjoyed the food.
Quite crowded on a weekend morning even when it just opened for the day. Ordered the small prawn noodles, big prawn noodles and the big prawns zuke. Also had the prawn roll and the fried tofu.
The starters selection was very limited to only 4 items, would hope they can expand the selection someday. The mains serving was quite generous, and also like many have mentioned it's more on the expensive side. The broth is different from the prawn noodles and the prawn zuke, the prawn noodles broth had the pork ribs flavour as well while the prawn zuke was purely prawn broth which I enjoyed more. The serving for the broth in the little teapot was not a lot, and the staff came to give me another refill which was then just sufficient for the dish. Was a wise move using short rice also, making the dish very tasty.
I personally liked the fried tofu but the prawn roll was nothing to shout about. I guess the portion is quite big so I don't see people ordering loklok.

4807,Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao,5,"Seeing the steak restaurant next door priced at 32.9 dollars, I immediately decided to dine at Crystal Jade.

A bowl of hot noodle soup must be the warmest treat for passengers traveling on planes or connecting flights. For diners who don't eat pork, you can order the beef brisket noodles and shrimp dumplings.

ü•©Beef Brisket Noodles
The soup base is reasonably rich, without any surprises, in a typical Chinese culinary style. The beef and brisket pieces are quite large, making it more satisfying than scallion oil noodles.

ü•©Shrimp Dumplings
These are large shrimp dumplings, following the Cantonese style. The dumplings are a bit dry, suitable for quick meals.

ü•©Bamboo Shoots
This seems to be a specialty side dish at Jade Kitchen, ordered by almost every table. However, it has a peculiar taste, with too much sugar, resulting in less saltiness. It's the kind of dish where you can feel a novice chef trying hard to cook, but no matter what, they can't achieve a consistent and flavorful seasoning. However, when eaten with the rich soup-based noodles, it creates a unique combination. It's a magical dish and a specialty of this restaurant. But at 8.8 bucks
the price seems a bit high, considering you get only a small portion of bamboo shoots, around 100g.

If you only eat the noodles, it might offer better value for money.

2548,Majestic Restaurant,5,"Highly recommend this place for wedding for small (70-100)pax weddings. We had our wedding here in July and it was great!

Food: The restaurant allowed us to customise our own menu. All the dishes on the actual day were luxurious and delicious. The portions were generous and the presentation of the dishes were a feast for the eyes. Our guests loved the food!

Cost: The cost per head of S$150++ was really worth it for the quality and quantity of our seven course meal. The minimum spend required for booking the whole venue is also a reasonably achievable amount for a small wedding.

Coordination: The floor manager Doris Wong was helpful, accommodating, and kind. She helped us iron out many stressful hiccups before and during the wedding, and we are really grateful for her to help to create a smooth-sailing night.

Flexibility: The venue allowed us to rent our own sound system, set up a band, and do our own decorations.",2023-08-21T06:05:51.602Z,2,YY,47.0,True,,,6 months ago,,Dinner,,$100+,Dine in,5.0,5.0,5.0,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwbFotZ3RBRRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2guuTO2uxgU9oJKF28iv5M38xcX0pTbBzhkzw=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhxz-yAHEKq51Y12ET5gZxneBAIOIU5j012Rku=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-a-YJ7H6c824dFNqALRQal_AtvK18a8HDZahm=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxZEVLZCp5oIXrDGTuHGtseWZjjlnEVjydeQPd=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipND537I6syqnpXzNVdWqIb7JA2V2tAP6Aw1S1hX=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3ilikzP96GIXvE_LoQ5tmaLe93ObOXHuFneMt=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwbFotZ3RBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x79acd6b99b2f3477!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICplZ-gtAE%7CCgwIv_2LpwYQuKCLnwI%7C?hl=en,101443789417759529452,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXgaJoHAbJkbzUm5l1NBpzcvIHt7tDh4MiE5LrFVHtqRno=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101443789417759529452?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,161

We ordered 2 sets of Tonkatsu sets that come with salad and a drink. Food took a while to come but from the first taste of the curry (Level 1 spiciness) I was hooked! The curry was perfectly cooked and the spice level just right. The pork was freshly fried and totally worth the value.

However, every staff that I encountered was friendly, polite and professional. The food was yummy and surprisingly filling despite the fact that the portions didn't look very big.

3766,Element Restaurant Amara Singapore,1,"Came this evening (15/02/24) for a valentine date. Very disappointed in the food and service here. Initially saw it on TikTok when some influencer promoted it, it looked good there. Now I understand, maybe it was a paid promotion.

First of all, the atmosphere is not the best. Tables were placed very close to one another. When you walk in, it just doesn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre walking into a hotel standard buffet.

Then the service, the man at the sashimi bar was rude. When we ask for the sashimi, we are greeted with ‚Äúwhat you want?!‚Äù In a very rude manner and they way he communicates with the customers is not nice. However, the staffs were fast to clear our used plates on the table and were borderline friendly.

Last, the food. The sushi doesn‚Äôt taste very fresh and of good quality. Same can be said for their snow crab legs, it wasn‚Äôt as fresh. The meat was rather dry and tasteless. I did not eat any of the raw food as I‚Äôm allergic, therefore no comments on the sashimi, mussels.

The cooked food was below average. It includes the self serve rojak station, roast pork, roast chicken, ghor hiang, herbal duck, stir fry pork and grilled chicken.

The acceptable cook food that was pretty good was their fried bee Hoon & chicken satay. Those were pretty yummy.

The WORST dish there was the Chilli crab. Now I don‚Äôt expect Tzar Char standard but it wasn‚Äôt even close. The crabs were extremely small, the meat was so dark in colour and it breaks apart so easily. It felt like the crab was stored for a long time. It taste very very bad. The sauce was okay with the mantou.

Overall, I would not pay 98++ (dinner) for a buffet of this standard.

6384,Sankranti Restaurant,1,"Ordered mutton bryani.
Food was cold! Top part was hot bottom part was cold!

Whole restaurant only 3-5 people when i vist at around 4.35pm on 1jan2024.

The first thing the service staff tell me is no more food. Only left mutton bryani which is the food i wanted to eat.
He doesnt seem to be interested as i was not done with my order. I had to call him before he left after serving another family to follow up on my order.
And prior to my order he didnt even bother to give us a menu and insisted only left bryani and we had to ask for drinks menu to catch some of the drinks that are supposedly still available.

Food had 1 small hair on my yogurt! Can see in photo! Very hard to spot.

My wife had advised me not to visit as the review is bad and as a fan of indian food i couldn‚Äôt help myself but go against her advise.

Atmosphere at the cashier have a strong stench smell. The cashier girl only pass us the bank receipt at first, we had to ask for the food receipt then she give us.

7281,Samy's Curry Restaurant,4,"Samy‚Äôs Curry in Dempsey stands apart with a distinctive ambiance, diverging from the sophisticated, fine-dining feel of its neighboring restaurants. Instead, it embraces a canteen-like atmosphere adorned with an 80s colonial setting, offering a nostalgic journey through time.

As a family-owned establishment, the culinary highlights include the fish head curry, squid, and fish bergedil (fried fish and potato cutlet). Served in a generous pot, the fish head curry captivates with its spicy, tangy profile, enriched with curry powder, tomatoes, tamarind, and a subtle sweetness. The marinated squid delights with its moist tenderness, while the fish bergedil boasts a pleasing texture and aromatic appeal. Unfortunately, there weren‚Äôt many vegetarian options to choose from.

Have to drop one star because of the sanitary conditions of the place. As it‚Äôs a really small establishment, everything seems very cramped and a few times I have to walk like a crab just to get back to my table.

Floor was sticky at most areas and towards the back of the shop it was wet with grey most stains all over. Imagine a wet market walkway. You‚Äôll get the drift.

This makes sense because rental and staff are not cheap for them too. I read through the review and there are some complain about customer service. Personally I do feel it and get what they mean. I don't feel very comfortable eating there, this is the first time I feel this way in a restaurant. Maybe because of the ""pay as you like concept"", and most people don't pay a lot. The feeling is like you are there for a free meal. It is a nice place and I like the food there, I rather that they charge a fix price for the buffet rather than the ""pay as you like concept"". Maybe their 3rd floor can have a buffet corner where they charge a fix price. And people will be more comfortable there.

1471,Greenwood Fish Market,2,"Went for our Anniversary Celebration yesterday night at Greenwood Fish Market @Quayside Isle. Overall food was good and we love the environment and atmosphere but was disappointed there are no more Resident discount.

Me and my family have been a loyal customer of this restaurant for quite some time, and I've always appreciated the discount provided to Sentosa Cove Residents. However, during my yesterday visit, I was surprised to learn that the discount policy had changed, and the staff's communication about this adjustment was rather disappointing. The person I spoke to seemed uninterested in addressing my concerns and exhibited a somewhat rude attitude. I've always valued the positive experiences I've had here, and the change in policy coupled with the unfriendly encounter left me feeling disheartened. I believe that clear communication about policy changes is crucial, and it would be beneficial for the staff to approach such matters with a more customer-friendly demeanor.

2005,Noyah La Maison,4,"They are having a promotional breakfast set that costs $6.90 for a main and a drink. I was expecting the portion to be small and so I ordered the salted egg mayo croissant as a second main. But boy, was I very wrong. The portions are decent for an individual. The food tastes good too, and I especially love the achar like salad that comes with the croissant - it helps to get the appetite going. The laksa gravy is rich, which probably explains why they pair it with yellow noodles. It would have been better if they serve traditional Southeast Asian type of coffee instead of cappuccino or lattes.

10861,Hilltop Garden Restaurant,4,Was here for a Wedding Lunch and pleasantly surprised by the well thought out vegetarian menu they served being a non-vegetarian restaurant. They was a good variety of dishes with my favourite being the ÂúüË±Ü‰∏ù (Stir-fried Shredded Potato) in this starter. There was also a giant Ëç∑Âè∂È•≠ (Lotus Leaf Wrapped Rice) towards the end of the course which everyone had a hard time finishing. The staff are nice but perhaps a little too casual and sometimes rough when serving - bumping into things and attendees. I was quite surprised when one of them just poured the leftover peanuts onto the plate I was eating from. It was also crazy cold and parents had to keep carrying their babies outside to warm up.,2018-12-19T01:57:42.798Z,0,Kelita Yeo,47.0,True,,,5 years ago,,,,,,,,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJeUw2dnNBRRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVaMApfacGS1hOwVBeqbo2muekygD9tG5MhH47=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtOBuMLPVc1esDVLdnIln3dR2kWqmQsAbtZPpH=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJeUw2dnNBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xbf10b39fb7b43e3a!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDIyL6vsAE%7CCgwIlsvm4AUQk5Hk_AI%7C?hl=en,101846300661262663905,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXOvuQGpkaBth1k0YBFOdAisU5gJlJ3zZ1VN3Rc1Pf4RRA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101846300661262663905?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,122

5587,Pixy Restaurant & Bar,4,"This was my first time at Pixy Restaurant.

The food were all made from the freshest ingredients, with seasonal flavours. The chef (boss) is extremely friendly, and the sole waitress complemented him very well, as a dynamic duo.

The Sakoshi Bay Oysters were extremely fresh and the Sashimi Carpaccio was immaculately grilled on the outside, while  juicy and tender inside.

Their Kagoshima Wagyu Beef A5 steak was accompanied by an exciting array of vegetables and sides.

Its Japanese Carbonara was very creamy and rich, and it contains top grade bacon.

A very good dining experience, and I look forward to return there.

From the moment I stepped inside, I was captivated by the restaurant's elegant interior, which perfectly set the stage for what would be an unforgettable experience.

There were many highlights to the meal. One of my favorite was the aburi sushi, especially the kinmedai sushi.  The perfectly seared fish was expertly prepared with the precision that only a fine dining establishment can offer. What made this dish truly exceptional was the ingenious use of shouldering wood, infusing the fish with a delicate, smoky flavor that danced on the palate. It was a masterclass in culinary artistry, a delicate balance of technique and creativity.

Another favorite was the beef dish. The beef was cooked to perfection and melts in your mouth.

The entire omakase journey was a symphony of flavors and textures, each course thoughtfully curated to showcase the finest ingredients and the chef's extraordinary talent. The attentive and knowledgeable staff added to the overall experience, guiding us through the courses with grace and expertise.

This restaurant has undoubtedly earned its place among the finest dining establishments in the realm of Japanese cuisine. I look forward to returning for another gastronomic adventure.",2023-09-25T15:11:46.366Z,2,May Lim,4.0,False,2024-02-06T09:25:33.944Z,,5 months ago,,Lunch,,$100+,Dine in,5.0,5.0,5.0,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURaOUw2WHNBRRAB,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURaOUw2WHNBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x332f6f0a87c15af1!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDZ9L6XsAE%7CCgwIssbGqAYQsM3IrgE%7C?hl=en,113535078641010105942,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocILvgF4XvLPrY0Vyn2XlIHk8XSt5IZVxZ4BnHjob8SC=s120-c-rp-mo-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113535078641010105942?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,208

Paired with Sultana Pulao, Mirchi Paratha, and Plain Kulcha, it was a perfect match and made me eat one plate after another.

The negative side that the management would like to improve on will be letting the diners enjoy our meals instead of rushing us off. We felt so stressed when we were not even done with our meals, the staff came over to clear away all the plates. This is very obvious chasing us off, just for the others in the queue to come in. There is no time stated for buffet. They should not do it this way.

1979,Luke's Lobster Singapore (Jewel Changi),4,"Been craving for lobster rolls.
They said lobster are from Maine, but texture definitely different.
In Maine, lobster meat size are bigger and texture is a bit chewy springy which i love.
Luke Lobster meat is similar to Indonesia's lobster texture.
A tad to hard side without springiness.
It is still the best one so far, none competitor.
But compared to Maine lobster roll, average.
I've had way better Lobster roll in Maine.

Grilled Bun is soft and full of butter flavor.
Lobster is mix with mayo, butter and lemon.

But there are few areas that I hope the restaurant could improve on:

1) the ramen soup was very salty. ( I don't know if it's my personal opinion, but this is the saltiest soup I've ever tasted.)

2) Dessert is served together with the food. By the time I've finished my ramen,my ice cream have already melted. ( From my experience dining in other restaurants, usually after u had finished your meal, then you request the staff for your dessert)

3) Hot tea is served in a porcelain cup, which make it too hot to even hold it. ( I could only able to drink it after it became cool tea üò≠)

If all the above can be improved,I don't mind coming again. If not, this might be my last time dining here again.",2024-03-05T11:23:38.267Z,0,Fion Law,4.0,False,2024-03-06T04:47:06.142Z,,2 days ago,,,,,Dine in,4.0,2.0,4.0,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5MXMtQ2FBEAE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5MXMtQ2FBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x387704b73d495bb4!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIC91s-CaA%7CCgsIuoGcrwYQqJ6xfw%7C?hl=en,107109249866701118254,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLfIzlZJtCTxcjfqw_l170_D9SrcBv6m6CUABAZzRAx=s120-c-rp-mo-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107109249866701118254?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,158

9926,Sin Ho (Block 16 Bedok South),1,"Good choice of dishes but very poor cooking. The pork slices in our ginger pork dish were cold, only the gravy was hot. The meat must have been pre-cooked, don't know how long ago, and the gravy simply warmed up and spread over the meat. Our order came super fast after placing order.
Another dish, black bean bittergourd was served much later and was piping hot and presented what we expected - food cooked to our order, not pre-cooked and warmed to serve.
So, it's your luck if you order common popular dishes which ingredients are prepped ahead and cooked en-mass with other customers' orders.
Dishes were very salty with lots of lard and oil. Cannot tell them less salt and no lard - staff taking orders told you it's no use, the cook won't care and could not be bothered.

4025,Swensen's @ Clementi Mall,1,"Food - Decent. A little overpriced considering the portion size and flavour. My burger was served on a wooden board that looked a little mouldy. (picture attached, you be the judge) The icecream seemed to have shrunk in size over the years, and was already melted on the outside by the time it arrived on the table.
Service - The male waiter that seated us was really polite and friendly. Was apologetic when we realised one of the chairs and the floor below it was wet. The other male waiter (who seemed to be the manager) we interacted with was really rude and impatient (the restaurant was not busy) when we were ordering our icecream. There was also a mix up with orders a few times, and we had food/drinks sent to our table by mistake. Other than that, service was pretty quick in terms of us getting our orders.
Atmosphere - Nice restaurant with a good view. However, since this is a family restaurant, there will be screaming kids from time to time.

10533,Restaurant Born,5,"Restaurant Born: A Culinary Masterpiece Unveiled

From the moment we first encountered the unique touch of Chef Zor Tan at Restaurant Andre, it was evident that a distinctive culinary voice was waiting to be fully expressed. We've had the privilege of experiencing the inaugural menu and the second menu at Born and both were excellent. Every dish not only captivated our senses but also unveiled the depth of passion and innovation that underpins the chef's journey.

Born's ambiance masterfully intertwines a welcoming warmth with sophisticated elegance, a testament to their meticulous attention to detail. The impeccable service mirrors the very qualities of warmth, professionalism, and thoughtfulness that they exude.

Watching Chef Zor evolve from his time at Restaurant Andre to taking the reins at his own establishment has been truly inspiring. Thank you for sharing your unparalleled culinary artistry with us.

We wish Restaurant Born all the very best and continued (well-earned!) success!",2023-10-24T02:40:41.637Z,1,Kathryn Rungrueng,3.0,False,,,4 months ago,,,,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ1bXN1aFhREAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_Y06ENU8h2pFOf7JK3XCXxkw8e5VVW2Nbd2En=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlwXg-tl0PZCAWa5PMyiqfmo63eA6EvBLoNEkR=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTXig0FsVdfe-hA0fNssExP2xSaJ5yDn9Wr9KM=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEryNCUXnzNaNRqscp0DIGl1gC0MhuATI-U47c=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZjUCRo8VTOZAWS8LAmT96NTBWAIi3BCh6TEZ7=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0GbYte3Ybxje2B7MCWeOj4a2R_cmfdpR4_PiJ=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsN7pyu3mQohwZecfzkumOZE5QCp9A84XfMJ70=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjyWaQde1oVHPSk_Xhc6IMdrjIBUlsOAvikaH5=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2FOP95ak_3U5xMNwwCkxlSt00PeSysFx8qyUS=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeiGqP7KAnF2CGLQH6HnZO-GRxjDYccxnICSga=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyq6qK7MaOysS8nG-3wRawXRUF7ak-WBkiO3OS=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLYKQA6N9ioiJNKsoSUSysuq1gUQxtO-MCJWCE=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_Gw4WshHSELH6DvUZqZwOPzk8tHHp-qGrdCXs=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAf6EDk-sXR3pJmtUoHVOthumo3nAAtECk4-gc=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeGWbGCRw1H-FIDEUlvIIpBRC7EC1KOfaQzSLp=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOD25W1OFyRiIm5Jy0STOetM3N0KjEUIf5rTgLp=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ1bXN1aFhREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x46b485adf1c81ac8!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID5msuhXQ%7CCgwIqd3cqQYQoN3wrwI%7C?hl=en,118016885093919445817,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX3IVB11xQVTRlSR3qkNrcyuM97TNsD9pF205unS1DzpVM=s120-c-rp-mo-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118016885093919445817?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,153

9028,Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata Restaurant in Singapore,4,"4 stars for the food not for the SERVICE! Pricing wise it‚Äôs acceptable and food is great but service wise they need to reorganise their worker and work flow.
Firstly, waiting time for food is so long not saying it‚Äôs a weekend or weekday other tables that are later than us got their food first and when we went to double check on our food their worker replied ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a queue so must wait‚Äù okay fine we wait so 10-15 mins later the food is not here yet so went to check again and told them our table have yet to have any items on the table they seems to be suspicious about us not telling the truth so we have to went back and forth many times just to check on our food order.
Secondly, I saw they put some food items onto their metal trolley which belongs to our table okay so we assume they were preparing our food but they didn‚Äôt! They left the food there and serve other tables food first while leaving those sides on the metal trolley!
Thirdly, after such a long long long time we finally get our food and guess what the person came to ask us to pay for our food. Wow we wait for our food for that long and you want us to pay our bill plus on a side note they miss out some of the items that were on the list.
Fourthly, there will be a lady incharge of billing and she will bring it to the cashier. So apparently this happen we told the lady that some items were missing and pass her a $50 together with the bill and she said she will come back with the change but ended up the lady came back claiming that we did not pass her the $50 but we did! Then next, one of her co-worker wearing a sarong top came and said ‚Äúyou guys said you pay the money but where‚Äôs the money‚Äù umm hello lady how the heck will i know where the money went we definitely did gave your co-worker the money for our meal!!! She claimed that there is 4 person working so which is the lady that we pass the money to? Umm i only see like 1 lady working throughout the entire shift tell me where is the other 3?
Lastly, the lady who took the $50 drank alcohol with her friends. Wow mind-blown man clap for this place‚Äôs mookata can work and drink at the same time.
Okay folks that‚Äôs it for the review of this place go ahead and try and see what experience you will get

It was surprisingly the crew that made the whole experience for me. They were friendly, attentive, could even get in on our jokes for a bit. Its a hot Sunday afternoon by the sea, you couldn‚Äôt ask for better vibes than this.

Food wise - Everything was fresh, delicious and beautifully presented. Nothing to fuss about! We were a group of 5 and had more food than what i‚Äôve attached in photos. They were so good i barely have time for proper photos before we dug in.

237,Rasa Istimewa Waterfront Restaurant,3,"The restaurant offers scenic views, situated as it is in a park by the sea.

During my visit,¬† the restaurant was crowded,¬† though i must say they have a pretty decent system in place to usher in diners.

Surprisingly the queue moved fast and before long we were ushered to a seat by the window.

Order taking was quick and food was served in double quick time.

The food was only OK in my opinion although I must admit that the Vegetables in garlic sauce were good to eat and cooked well too.

I must certainly give credit to the staff and service crew who were quick and willing to serve.

Overall it was a Fast into the Restaurant and Fast out of the restaurant as well.¬† Pricing seemed really reasonable.

4301,Yuan Xing Chaozhou Restaurant,2,"<√∂+ TasteMarked Reviews +√∏>
Experience not very good. I came here during lunch hour with colleagues. Food tasted very plain, shrimp not fresh, steam fish over cooked, soup over-powered by Chinese cooking wine taste. Most important of all - serving speed is extremely slow (we are just one of the 3 tables), and both our table and the table next to us are constantly asking them to speed up. We spent most of the time just waiting. Absolutely not suitable for business lunch.
What I like:
- plenty of parking lots
- air conditioned
What can be improved:
- food taste need to be greatly improved
- serving frustratingly slow",2018-10-08T05:37:26.544Z,5,Steven Li,73.0,True,,,5 years ago,,,,,,,,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBelktLXNBRRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfUQ4y8qlzKFM8iucDNTB5aO0ptZUSQCDGhanh=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMe_FNxBEU1GLnLrm-5GjGz9T_oqrPapLl085Jr=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbqhowJJWtKR_q34khVybenisaNEZV5W_CDlgm=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzm2rwHm_Fq1KXvQhKdE1jyJOjDVtV7KjH9k_s=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAZG4X4L5H_NZcvcWnhPLuM42UvakMwnyRPGad=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPU3u8q7kw6xAnU27YbiB8n2fKUlgd-5EtQt-1h=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLo5y2eMnMV_FyLh0ZTSPa34KQlTuerhcvh1YM=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPN0J3poCFij-FldqUkZyYbYSLdteoHHJ5rbYgH=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZ_rW4yly1YXmQdD6MOMJ52xjV0JzBn27S1_Xg=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKc5uEHXWDou1fwQgpPHU-u1YZn00ACMOKYevd=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNl9Lo_DgVxYjcutL6RdwHe0pgtxOoPRlOtp8R0=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBelktLXNBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x8d2ccef01affd948!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICAzY--sAE%7CCgwIltrr3QUQmI3bgwI%7C?hl=en,100923375930929911174,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVWuzQTXUqCIL3v-O8p8NDbe4GkvOWu93sB275tPii3Kw4=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100923375930929911174?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,110

6219,Fiamma,5,"The service was outstanding, the staff were very friendly, professional and immaculate. The highlight was the pizza, this was like it was made in Napoli and the ambience was just perfect. The dough and toppings were made from the finest ingredients, better than any pizza I have had in Australia and better than I have had in Lake Como. The carpaccio fish (sashimi) was delicate and delicious. The smaller steak size which we ordered wasn‚Äôt on the menu but we couldn‚Äôt eat such a large serve that was offered and they accommodated to our needs. The steak was seasoned perfectly and cooked medium rare also to perfection. I can‚Äôt speak more highly of this restaurant that is at Capella.

10181,Path Restaurant,4,"I rarely have a ""fancy"" lunch but on a friends recommendation (she also hasn't been), we decided to give it a try. Great first impressions upon entering the restaurant- very agreeable interior design and furnishings and a very warm welcome was extended. The menu was indeed interesting with 2, 3 and course options priced very reasonably at $45, $55 and $65. The selection was not extensive but very well curated with sufficient choices to whet one's appetite. There are surcharges for more premium selections but we found them very worthwhile and value for money. 4 of us ordered various combinations and every dish from starters to desserts were impressive from plating presentation to taste. In short  a great restaurant with a well curated menu, very well executed dishes (sauces for all mains and starters were uniquely different), great elegant ambience and certainly value for money. I would return to dine here for sure. The Chef definitely knows what he is doing and the service crew was great ..attentive, responsive and knowledgeable.

I ordered 3 dishes  - steamed pork belly (Ê¢ÖËèúÊâ£ËÇâ), steamed sea bass, a vegetable plus soup . The vegetable and soup were great but when it came to the steamed pork belly, we were shocked to find out that the inside of the dish was frozen! Which means the dish wasn't prepared to order. They must have cooked it on another occasion, kept in the freezer, and steamed it again before serving. When we informed the server, she hurriedly told the lady boss who replied it's ok - we can steam it again?!? When the sea bass was served, we also noted that almost a third of the flesh on one side of the fish was missing. As I had a guest with me, I didn't want to kick up a fuss. There were obviously a lot of other repeat customers in the restaurant as they know the lady boss personally.

5628,"NAYANA Kpop Cafe & Restaurant@Poiz, Central Singapore, nice late supper Korean food, indoor pet friendly, vegetarian options",4,"Looking for a place to hangout and not so crowded. Randomly chanced upon this on google map and there i went.
Serves a great variety of korean food, including sliced noodle, korean dumpling soup, chilli hotplate chicken with cheese.
An authentic rare find for a kpop style cafe filled with female kpop singer music.

I presume i can visit a few more times just to try all the good food.
The korean dumpling soup is delicious, with smooth and tasty dumplings, filled with meat and rice vermicelli.
The hotplate chilli chicken is lacking compared to chuncheon dakgalbi, but still tender and filling for us.
The 3x chilli tofu stew is my friend's personal favorite, but its too spicy for me. Definitely packed a punch.

The bad thing about this place is that the air-conditioning is bad, and we are sweating profusely with hot and spicy food.
Plus, the side dishes are lacking, only got 3 type although unlimited refill of kimchi.
But the service from the staff is not bad, prompt and friendly.

There was a robot server that also helped to sing the happy birthday song. We had the braised beef cheek, the pan seared salmon, the striploin steak, and it also has 2 free kids meal for every 2 paying adults who order from the set meals. It's basically a 3 course dinner.

5811,Cheese Story Mookata Buffet,3,"As we walked around the building thinking about what to eat after learning that our initial plan of having Mookata buffet was smashed due to that the shop was closed for a short period of time, we decided on an alternative Mookata Buffet at Cheese Story.

Before the pandemic, diners can help themselves with the free flow of food items from the designated collection point. Diners have to fill up the form on their preferred order.

The server set up the Mookata stove with few big pieces of pork lard in the middle of the pot surrounded by a pool of stock and a small tray of cheese by the side.

Let's wait for the pot to get hot and the lard to be melted so as to oil the pot.

Besides having meat, we do order some vegetables, quail eggs and vermicelli items.

Here are some more of our orders with cheese tofu, fish cake, hotdog, dumplings, luncheon meat etc.

Do not worry about the shells if you are ordering the crayfish as the server on duty will help us to deshell.

One of the consolations is that the service includes deshell of the crayfish which we find quite comfortable. The staff on duty will do it on the spot in front of us with a pair of gloves.

Other than that, the free flow of oysters. The oysters are plump and they are generous with the servings.

Other than Oysters, abalone, prawns, and crayfish. We have ordered bamboo clams, scallops, Lala, sotong (Squid) and deshelled prawns that were marinated with garlic chilli.

Here's our second round of meat, They are marinated with black pepper and garlic.

Let's dig in! The chilli they provided is not too bad but I prefer to dip most of my food into the cheese tray.

The shredded cheese was left at the side tray of the Mookata pot to melt with Nachos cheese. For the price of $29.90 Nett for Buffet style of Mookata, I find it worthwhile with the unlimited flow of seafood. Drinks are unlimited too and the server will come with a trolley of drinks and assist to top up our cups.

For the quantity and money, I will say one can enjoy having Mookata at a budgeted price. If you don't mind spending more on quality style Mookata, there are better ones within Golden Mile Complex.",2021-05-25T05:54:25.653Z,2,umake mehungry,282.0,False,,,2 years ago,,,,,,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxeU9DTEF3EAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdmVpTPJOFKth09kNg3ob9vEEU4gxiImSvbOwg=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7uK31awVjceoCsmUROtTZ1gYgphhCTJT9o1b7=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMp-Tx0vVNqFaHQrybLiG-gyZRBBj7lLFOXGjnd=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQHRwANKzBnzyrRE9uxXh9h2tnpDi1cCEQGGxM=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOi681kkPBoX-hwGOh7T2l0M8sMvM1MEoRYITq=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPL2GzAznWv6bLRNWBU7JNij26pawZxSVTOjaGg=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOs_M4oZvhr8_u7S401bDnx32qATyx59NffaG4x=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5PY73PY-iq7FmT6u56UoqbwJWweNiRFsxOTRW=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIECPrzQ6A3gz3yVv9X3rMV3AEZ9Du3IRBwfSb=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRkNlocJp2HRR80n9T3khTs-poEaWeP9S-cbul=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNaJHP699PESx5E0SWDzxU2ruAqvoIRmVE9Crj1=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHGC6f5ykOsEEzrTstRxSxe6BudYfl8hNcXFCN=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUgTnDqRu-WUk_giVBpT1IvJBPfTPjbj2h8nbI=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNo7kP6Qu3mhBthUpS1dOBgJcWcpRohMgJMd6Pk=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxeU9DTEF3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xdfd16e0cbb3d93f3!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICqyOCLAw%7CCgwIkaKyhQYQ6MLZtwI%7C?hl=en,111406931807185833571,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVFfMhvVs6JpQh2p8CY1FSDro1aJOeCnaXYELXjuUnLbg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111406931807185833571?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,397

2519,Numb Restaurant Â∑ùÈ∫ªËÆ∞,5,"We had:

Classic Chengdu Seabass in Sour Pickled Soup which was seasoned just nice for my taste - not overly sour with a hint of chilli.  I usually dislike seabass but this really changed my view.

Awesome Spicy Chilli Chicken (minus the Fried Dough Twist) which was aromatic with great spicy and numbing flavour.  The little bits of dried garlic in the dish was fragrant as well.

Sichuan Inspired Traditional Homemade Mapo Tofu was a little oily but it was surprisingly spicy.

Stir-fried Jack Beans with Red Chillis and Sichuan Pickles is usually a hit-or-miss dish. Most restaurants fail to remove the fibrous seams but here they have done really well. Each stalk was plump and full of flavour.

Osmanthus Fermented Wine with Rice Balls was a sweet ending to the savoury dinner.  It's good if you have a sweet tooth.

The only thing that wasn't ideal was the plain rice which was probably pre-scooped as the top layer had already dried and hardened.",2024-02-27T14:00:29.022Z,0,Pauline W,100.0,False,,,a week ago,,Dinner,,,Dine in,5.0,5.0,5.0,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkbThfVF93RRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUUJxWQyxnwomawLYIGbLE6RfAjw0Xs1D5OJVZ=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYelKtOiVhwgg58DLtvtzWz27l7UNusFzFOshd=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAoIzkS_nPCiWd3pll6aZstbEe9VM1g7Tz4C7i=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMoY9EMbNKpZcey3Q5rozjJvn9zFQujR975iUgZ=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO70dmL3ImPhCtqbEByvQvZ8xeXobGnGjAL8HsR=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkbThfVF93RRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xf3d17db878772450!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDdm8_T_wE%7CCgsI_dX3rgYQyNDmCg%7C?hl=en,110148346935144645330,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV407fmyEXHxArIMpXdVOwzYMTb2gyuIHqOgzQws3-w2Z8=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110148346935144645330?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,164

From the mouthwatering satay and succulent BBQ chicken wings to the flavorful fried Hokkien mee and fried oyster, every bite is a delightful experience.

One standout dish for me was the Sambal sting ray fish, a unique and delicious option that‚Äôs a must-try. And don‚Äôt forget to quench your thirst with their refreshing sugarcane drinks.

3796,Sol & Ora,5,"Sol & Ora

Located on a quiet level of The Outpost Hotel Sentosa, Sol & Ora is a Mediterranean cuisine restaurant with a Latin vibe.

What caught my attention were the Greek dishes on the menu. The only thing that came to my mind was Ouzo,  a dry anise-flavored aperitif that is widely consumed in Greece.

However, other than some of the Greek wines, I see no Ouzo. I tried my luck and asked the restaurant manager, who is a Russian-Greek, to offer me his private stash of Ouzo.

He explained that as there is only a small committee of Greeks in Singapore, not many restaurants or people will know such a spirit. Well, I'm sure glad that I asked.

Spirits aside, food and service were great. The restaurant manager was jovial and able to recommend wine pairing dishes.

The octopus dish is a must-order dish. The parma hams blended so well with the unsalted octopus and well grilled potatoes.

Food: üçª üçª

7110,Restaurant Euphoria,5,"it deserve a 2-star, it is worth a detour.

Forgive me if i cant praise this restaurant higher and better.

Their service is excellent, they respect every guests, serve politely and most important, they are able to present their food with confidence, which I don‚Äôt often see that in many Michelin 1-star restaurants.

Their theme is onion, every bit of this restaurant cohere with this theme and very well executed. Every dish has its own stunning way to impress diner, each has its little back story and each is presented in an surprising manner. I appreciated the bomba rice the most as it shows the bravery and innovation the chef has with the food, even it is just rice. Not sure if they call themself molecular gastronomy, but last time I had such innovative experience was in Bo innovation.

And as equally important, I think they are quite generous in using luxury ingredients, like a ping pong size caviar is just pure indulgent.

I don‚Äôt have much Michelin 2star dining experience but among other 1 star restaurants I had in the past, this one is simply the best and deserve differentiation from the rest.",2022-12-16T01:05:31.224Z,0,jason,83.0,True,,,a year ago,,Lunch,,,Dine in,,,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMHRtQzBBRRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTipLKVs85lXXYmwsB8VLH9Qr9cQfWl-ReTl-_=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjuaBSUrwwGe1EKp9xRzlezLPivfbXcEV6uDrA=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbXFQCDW8LEFP4zaMkLpRNM_Ben-uef6IbEgOY=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrC6O1qPbhkTAsvI7NvffDCPkELqWJEcXEpmx7=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXJOuufksbKQdBnvxnqhYPIw6OalDqAEE3_VcV=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMHRtQzBBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xc8722006f054d784!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDe0tmC0AE%7CCgsI24jvnAYQ4Kudaw%7C?hl=en,114846144741751671056,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocI5pGaL0DPrKcOgrr4bMzuo39dldau0OK_AnNlxYvAG=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114846144741751671056?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,194

7114,Genki Sushi Junction 8,4,"On my visit this time around, I spent around $80 for 2 pax which is quite pricey in my opinion, but we managed to sample a variety of dishes. My craving for Japanese cuisine led me back to this familiar location, as I've had decent experiences with this sushi chain in the past. This time, however, my dining experience was satisfactory but not exceptional. The food was decent, and the service was average, although one staff member appeared visibly discontent.

As usual I'd order their salmon belly sashimi which is acceptable, 3/5, and their salmon sashimi which was disappointing,1/5. Both the sashimi dishes were not fresh at all, and they were poorly sliced. The only difference was that the salmon belly sashimi came in thicker slices compared to the regular salmon sashimi.

Their Chuka Idako, seasoned baby octpopus, were a little too big for my liking. The takoyaki was also quite poorly made. They were a little overcooked on the outside, tasted dry on the inside, and they did not give it enough toppings. Their fried squid tentacles were also a little too salty in my opinion. I also ordered their scallop sushi which was quite tasteless and not worth the price. I tried their promotional dish, the snow crab leg sushi, and it was also not worth it. The crab leg was too tiny. Another promotional dish I tried was the crab chawanmushi and it was the best dish out for all.

Overall, my dining experience here so far has been alright. For the quality, I'd say this place is a little overpriced. While dining here is acceptable, don't expect top quality food or service.

I ordered food delivery from here via Grabfood. I had their salmon sashimi, salmon belly sashimi and hotate sashimi. Surprisingly this time round the Sashimi was better compared to when I dined in. The quality was better, it tasted fresher and the cuts were better sliced. I also ordered some variety of sushi and all were decent. What surprised me the most was the delivery time. It was delivered 10mins faster than Grab's prediction despite me ordering slightly past lunch time.",2023-12-24T07:02:05.964Z,0,Bryan Lon,124.0,False,,,2 months ago,,Dinner,,$40‚Äì50,Dine in,4.0,4.0,3.0,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwaDRmVVRREAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTQquWkGL8j_0gZGdjLqwYBDCUQOat3BWJHYRv=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPExhRWPC0JD2_c-KvfdwwgdkyPttGQkws2d6Hh=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCe8sucI-w32jF064QuBGsn8LhENJdIi-GKmiJ=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLsB8hOYJf_IdebmCwizpC_dxqBS7msvJCW0lu=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPsQRLw8E0vnKGaUfsQcpFFQIed7phOk5Rrl3Il=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQN9TiKZ8Nvc_HwfRquP0QN2gOjugbWpZE27ya=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAowZJINHdWmkqxPAIExa8k3bndpnM-bR-vQw2=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMd_3GtAMZSZ4OoTL6qEztpOAq7MB-weJ9Ydic3=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNArI1d_r9lppEB80cUuRwdIAYbGixLLZ8fh1iL=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVwItlS3979wHvt-Mfx5Y5bm1nQLimxvnU6qYH=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeAgHUbc5yaaebsF2clm0W_bFUsSvrlhig1Mmp=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6kgLaI7JjFxTXZNkpQulnPC3Dm2r-E5mBcuhb=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuf_k_SBa8kPMyMWLDt4_Wp0WxbjxVJJeFQIOG=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfxYqtnxiLdxkDrl3o8klOpg6CtMFDpqJWodfr=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3n1jUYbm9ykDIiw41bb5gy03jQBiFiJPEvevW=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUp2Yb9B1rMDAtF90ftJ9DuAXiWDWBbg5CyMFg=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwH4frIky4ogbOBWoBCO_nfTGtakJISKZoD-6W=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEozKkFtZ7f0SFMAWsjFNg2TAxlok7P7s7Iz2f=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUIP9lAsxhsjEvwQjchlm2EjHG8sL2euHuim0e=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODmfrTP2DB34GJAw2FJH2y7bVB07QZQfcNrN4v=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwXuqg053cz1sH1zuhmcnNHIwLickCI9UYXZjw=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnhlTvlFFyFLe-z7mMDalXmviZ6JsqDXpGsW9l=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKeZDqNtsIazOL7yhi67lBoZkteel3QsXKylfc=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHYdxptwCP-mYBlf0apYK5S6DSLQeOlcdX-Xhj=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhGBhMd2sf_T_0MAvJivv2gmPeT1QCqBu4bTGN=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwaDRmVVRREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x46d6046d2966f4e0!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDph4fUTQ%7CCgwI7a6frAYQiPjgywM%7C?hl=en,101869506055887544256,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW8_LaMy35UJfcxn3gMaT-5KhsBwwizgIT1hTu9DuS05Nxh=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101869506055887544256?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,359

2069,Azur,2,"This is the first time i encounter a restaurant that refuse early guest when they are not even half filled. We had a reservation at 7pm, however we made ourselves arrive earlier because we both were excited about our date. Never did we expect that hotel of such calibre would refuse to seat their guest until 15 mins before reservation time. How inflexible.

The food is nothing fantastic. Label of food is wrong placed, some with no label. Chicken rice too oily, satay cooked on hotplate is not acceptable hotel restaurant standard. Maybe the foreigners can accept this. only 4 types of cheap seafood on ice. How pathetic. the Cha soba was over cooked and still placed out for guest. the noodles was mushy and sauce was super diluted. Did the chef even try what was placed out?

Never will i recommend anyone here or return for another visit.

7076,Tsukada Nojo - Thomson Plaza,4,"Collagen soup is recommended. The taste is rich and essence of chicken is well-infused into the broth. Vegetables are fresh and sweet. I feel that for $19, the collagen soup can do better with at least some ingredients in it. Condiments, the leek oil is flavourful. Nanbe chicken could do better with better frying of the batter. The dish tasted a little under fried and batter was soft.

Staff used to be and could be more attentive. The broth was boiling away and they only adjusted the induction cooker upon request, twice.

5950,Osia Steak and Seafood Grill,2,"Cannot meaningfully recommend this. Below average experience. We ordered 3 Med rare ribeyes; one was burnt and sent back, the other was underdone (very rare) but we didn‚Äôt want to send back yet another steak. We ordered 2 lamb chops and sent back 1 for being burnt on the outside. Seafood platter (at 288) was poor; sauce was very one dimensional.

Service excellent and flatbread appetiser was good. Excellent service is the reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1.

This restaurant seems to cater to the patrons of rws instead of being a destination in itself. There are many better steakhouses at a similar price point in SG. The table behind us also complained about the seafood platter. That said, we were told the main chef was on leave the day we dined so perhaps our poor food was a one-off.

3443,Tanuki Raw @ Jewel Changi Airport,4,"Went there on a Friday for lunch with my family when I was on leave.  The restaurant is not crowded and we had all the attention from the waiter when we wanted to order the food.  The food also came promptly since there are only a few diners.  We ordered 3 freshly shucked oysters and 3 wasabi tartar oysters.  The oysters are fresh and thick and not surprisingly we  ordered more!  We went straight to the main course without any desserts.   We ordered Foie Gras Jewel Truffle Gyu, Charcoal-Grilled Char Siew Unagi and Spicy Mentaiko Don.  I must say the servings are not that big for big eaters but are sufficient for us as the ingredients are  overflowing the bowls.  Again, the ingredients used are fresh and that‚Äôs very important especially for Japanese restaurants.  We really enjoyed them very much and finished them in no time.  With good service and fresh ingredients, I would rate them 4-stars.   Price wise, they are not the cheapest but also not the most expensive Japanese Restaurants out there.

Ordered a pretzel, Salmon rosti and water. Both dishes tasted decent and were served quickly.
Unfortunately, water wasn't served till it was time for payment. By then had I finished my meal. There wasn't a word of apology or a hint of remorse for this regrettable service hiccup.  Say less about needing to pay an additional dollar for the glass of ""refillable"" water that I eventually left without having a sip of.
I  requested to be seated away from the smoking area and was met with a rude response from the server. The lack of proactiveness to help move my plates over sums up the disaster-class from the restaurant,  leaving me to move the plates by myself.

I know it‚Äôs a tourist area but for this price this food is not even a tenth as good as any random zichar shop in Singapore. It‚Äôs a shame to serve this fried rice in sg.

Xiaolongbao was mediocre at best and also $16.80 for 6. Stingray was not quite fresh but edible thanks to the sambal we were able to ingest that horrid fried rice. Oh also the vanilla milkshake was $13.80?? The only decent thing was that the $8.80 apple juice was at the very least freshly juiced

8256,Under Der Linden Restaurant,4,"It was a last minute search nearing 2 pm on a weekday for a lunch place after a very active outing with our 2 young ones.  My partner searched this place and I called to check if they are opened in the afternoon.  Many restaurants/cafes have their kitchen closed from 2 pm to 6 pm so you can never be too careful.  The man answering the phone was very polite and friendly and I made reservations for a table on the spot.

A very Pet friendly restaurant.  Many patrons brought their pooches with them - Air-conditioned indoors.  If you are allergic to doggie fur, this might not be ideal.

I like the decor and feel of the place.

The menu has a slightly limited variety.  Food quality is good.  Kids meal portion is generous - 2 can share!

Good place to come back to try the rest of the menu although car park could be a challenge for weekends",2022-12-27T08:34:55.363Z,6,Patrick Lau,179.0,True,,,a year ago,,Lunch,,,Dine in,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCX3N1dWFBEAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBqCzzuU6xPJD-t93FMzLMLhqErDDeXTIg5zTQ=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOT9uEE-QEhsNOEQ0DhPfNgQCopFCNKExbkrScA=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVI5gT_IBZbGA07w1RTwtmbApETq5jx_s2-gNI=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPISt2Wt3gIEcupQvJaFikRNBeMKpcj8-xEY7QX=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9F2hWb0fVE7ZEbOKZlZ2KwnbRLImkZnlCEQNK=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOozb_Kf6SBaAXGgrHtt5jNs-Zc3fuUyzuK2yUB=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCX3N1dWFBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xd5927ea036ab800e!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICB_suuaA%7CCgwIr9yqnQYQ2KacrQE%7C?hl=en,106881591692184457438,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW_ofkBa6qfaAb38xVniPX1S9VI_1FpDW1L9BWJf1eBgJU=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106881591692184457438?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,159
1939,Enak Enak Restaurant (Simpang Bedok),2,"Food standard has dropped by so much, my family and I came down here quite frequently. Especially during special events such as birthdays and we always order their seafood, sambal sotong, sweet and sour seabass and stringray and we used to enjoy it so much. However, today when we came down all the food was disappointing, the stingray look so different, it was wet and very watery not the usual sambal bbq stringray that we ate where the sambal is slightly drier and the sambal look more darker. Their sambal sotong also came in looking very different the sambal was so watery that it looked no different from the sweet and sour sauce. Also, some of their cockles tasted bad like they were spoilt. Approached the staff to give our feedback not to demand any refund or replacement of food, but it seems like they were lazy to entertain and just said it was the same. However, looking back at all the past review and seeing the sambal stingray and now there is clearly a difference.

9433,Fu Lin Men Chinese Restaurant (National Service Resort & Country Club),1,"Most horrible experience ever. Made a reservation on Quandoo, went down and they told me Quandoo made a mistake because they are fully booked. Our booking was for 7pm and we arrived at 655pm. There were 3 big tables empty at that time. Told me it was for 730pm reservation. If they had let me in at 7pm, some other tables would have been done at 730pm. A family came in later than 730pm and apparently knows the manager. Manager ushered them to the empty at the front. They seemed to dislike the table or for some other reason wanted to change their table. Manager moved them to another empty table inside and suddenly we now have a table. What kind of reason could it be that when a family switched seat there was suddenly an available table? It means that there was a table available all this time? And they waited 45 min to give us a table?

So we finally sat down and ready to place our orders. Waited 15 min to have our orders taken by apparently only the managers can take order. But at this point all the managers suddenly disappeared.

There were flies flying around and I even killed one on the menu. We saw someone‚Äôs Peking duck getting served and they dropped the cracker on the table. The waitress picked it up with his bare hands and put it back on the plate. That was when we know we had to get out of there. We waited 45 min for a table despite having a reservation, 15 min just to have someone come to us to take order. 1 hour for nothing.

Overall a very bad experience and will never be back without even trying their food. They blamed the app but it is on the restaurant to at least have the courtesy to call the patrons and let them know? It is Mother‚Äôs Day and everywhere else is fully booked. Where do they expect us to get a table?",2022-05-08T12:14:40.873Z,1,Wanyi Chia,6.0,False,,,a year ago,,,,,,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyck15amJBEAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8WE8uu7ctUbEjSfxgSg3h5pB_TnhQP2tdSDd8=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOa_6s5B8vfnpz2HdM8B8xajoZkgkeRaVJ_Q_BP=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyck15amJBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xede06fb4f9278e4c!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID2rMyjbA%7CCgwIsOjekwYQsNPeoAM%7C?hl=en,108780584033395180987,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVNAo5uSdK42jpBiqkpUS-q1BpFi6E9r1bNOYKfPMCv6dM=s120-c-rp-mo-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108780584033395180987?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,336

918,Uncle Leong Signatures (FairPrice Hub),5,"Went for the $65 curry fish head set meal that comes with the following
- 1 curry fish head
- 1 meat (choose between 2 options)
- 1 beancurd dish (choose between 2 options )
- 1 veggie (choose between 2 options)
- 3 white rice

Absolutely yes!

This is an outstanding culinary experience not to be missed. First and foremost, the food is world class. Certainly one of the strongest 3 Michelin star menus I have had in recent times. All dishes were complex and multi-layered in their sensations, yet utterly delicious.

I also really enjoyed the flow of the dinner, starting at the ground floor with some excellent choice of bubbles, first nibbles and the now iconic showcase of ingredients, before moving on to the main dining room.

The wine list seemed well curated. Apart from the obvious super high end choices there was a decent range of more modest options. We had a Savagnin from Jura and a bottle of German Sp√§tburgunder, both excellent and great value.

The sommelier and the whole team were just a delight to interact with.

1271,Parker Korean Restaurant,5,"I take personal issues with keyboard warriors that has zero empathy to the elderly owners

Ignore all the reviews that critique at the elderly couple service standards. Both are in retirement and working everyday in a F&B (widely known to be gruelingly laborious) and running the whole operations+kitchen entirely on their own. Cut them some slack. Once, the couple had forgotten my request to top-up the side dish, but you don‚Äôt see my throwing a hissy fit. Be an adult and try to help them so you can get what you need, rather than retreat into your own shell, not get what you want and whining about it later

Have more empathy. What do you stand to gain by destroying two elderly livelihood who are trying to make an honest living. Stop trying to ruin honest businesses with this toxic cancel culture nonsense.

On the main topic - food critiquing:
(+) Food is great, one of the best Korean food in the area. Authentic and reminds me of my days in Korea. Nothing in Singapore comes close to authencity of the Korean food I vividly remember

(-) Food selections are few, not a Korean BBQ place if you‚Äôre looking for one but sells Korean cooked food

5711,Sin Ming Roti Prata Faisal & Aziz Curry Muslim Food,5,"Sin Ming Roti Prata serves up very well done pratas in a coffeeshop that has a decent selection of foods. Their menu is extensive boasting 19 different sorts of prata (whether they are available all day, I'm not sure)!

Ordered 1 egg and 1 kosong today and paid $3.30 for that. A look at their cooking process shows 4 people around the prata grill, 2 'shapers' and the main prata-flipper whom I assume is the boss, leading his other subordinate over the grill. They also seem to cook it slower, and with less oil used compared to other establishments.

The kosong was served fluffed up, whilst having a decent enough amount of crispy parts. The egg prata felt like i was biting into a soft pillow of dough and egg. Very enjoyable indeed! Their dough has a tinge of sweetness to it too - I would know since I have my pratas without sugar or curry. Honestly, they are one of the better prata shops around, and their daily morning crowd is proof of that.

7297,Pham Quyen Vietnamese Cuisine @ Pasir Panjang Rd,3,"Really disappointed with meal here. Also disappointed with owners response - why not accept failings which are obvious from the pictures rather than blaming customer! Shame manager wasn‚Äôt present but on reading response not sure how would have helped. Rival accusation is frankly rediculous and slightly embarrassing!
Pham Quyen restaurant did seduce us with lovely looking baguettes in the window and we relished the prospect of some pho and banh mi. Sadly despite the numerous baguettes and cooked chicken on display (see photo) was informed that as there was only one chef the restaurant had stopped any orders. I mean seriously no one else other than the head chef could put together the sandwich. The mood wasn‚Äôt helped by the 45 min wait for a bowl of average pho and minimal beef, which I was told was down to a very large online order. I think this place would benefit from prioritising customers in the restaurant and cutting down the menu to banh mi and pho - seems odd to me that ever since the old manager left they have decided to extend the menu.

4182,Maji Curry Square 2,1,"Ordered a triple meat plate adding an omelette and eggplant. Food portion is huge value for money but am surprise to see the pathetic amount of curry, (maji curry is a curry house rite?) hence requested for extra curry for an extra charge which is fine with me. The part i find seriously unacceptable - they insisted me walking to the shop entrance to just make a payment first before i can continue with my food.

502,Vineyard,3,"Can‚Äôt decide to give two or three stars.

Unfortunately the food was served really slowly on the day we went (Saturday night).

We ordered risotto, duck leg confit, an appetiser and two drinks. The duck leg confit took more than 40 mins to arrive. What was disappointing was 1) the table next to us received their duck leg confit before us even though they arrived later, 2) when it was finally served to us it was small and burnt. As we were too hungry we decided to just eat it anyway, but one of the staff saw the duck and offered to change it for us. If it weren‚Äôt for the staff we will be giving two star for this review instead of three.

Our dessert also took longer than expected to arrive (almost 30 mins after we asked for it to be served, even though we placed the order when we arrived).

The mushroom risotto and the appetiser tasted good though.

2300,ÏòàÏïΩ YeYak Korean Restaurant,3,"Food was okay. Portion was small. Definitely overpriced, especially considering the ulu location. Generous spacing between tables though.
We ordered 2 pax set menu ($60) which was corn cheese + spicy stir fried chicken + deep fried pork for two people. We had to buy burgers on our way home for the dinner again. I‚Äôd rather going to other Korean resraurants in the main road at Tanjong Pagar for the similar price to get more proper dinner. It is far from everywhere and located  in the hawker center building. But still more expensive than other stores in the better location‚Ä¶
The taste of foods was seriously, just average Korean. Nothing so special. Perhaps I expected too much after seeing the hypes in the google review.
The atmosphere was impressive though. It has a retro-Korean vibes with thoughtful touches of music, lights, and furnishing items. Tables are pretty well-spaced from each other, not like some Korean restaurants that make you eating squeezed by each other.
Oh also be aware that water is not free here. When we sit down and ask for ‚Äòwater‚Äô, they served the cold barley tea. I thought it‚Äôs nice as some authentic Korean restaurants serve barley tea rather than just ice water.

7038,Good Bites,3,"Service is good here, a malay lady was very attentive to our table when we require service. However, despite the high rating, food fell short of our expectation. Description of the physical menu and menu in the ordering page differs which made us feel shortchanged. Food is pretty pricey too while the quality was just not that great. Presentatiom could be better too,especially for the fries.

Ordered the following and here is my take:

Lamb chop - tasty and well cooked. Mashed potato is well seasoned too! Do share this dish though as you might find the lamb surfeiting after awhile.

Burger - was ok but patty was not well cooked. Could do with more sauce.

Chicken steak out - was ok, not the best chicken. Note that this does not come with calamari as per order page's description. Please update!

Strawberry latte - just a disappointment. Literally strawberry milk with shot of espresso. When mixed, it doesn't compliment each other. Can't taste the coffee too. For $10+ after gst? Just no.

Spicy chicken and fries appetizer - chicken is not even spicy the least bit :/ would have been good to have chicken coated with some spicy seasoning powder or sauce.

Overall, it was ok but there are better cafe hangouts. Location is quite a distance from bishan mrt too but good if you want to grab a meal after a workout. Place is quite squeezy too so it's not wheelchair-friendly or kid-friendly if your kid needs a baby chair.

Would i come again or recommend this place? I'd say please reconsider if it's for a celebration. Casual dining is fine but don't have very high expectations.

Nice deco for photos at the entrace!

He cannot control himself with the frustration on his facial expression, he seems too busy, all the tasks was delivered half way, for example, he didn‚Äôt bring me to the table, but point a table and told me I can sit there.
The menu does not have photo to provide reference, so I asked him for his recommendation, he mentioned 3 must try, but I can tell he is thinking we are wasting his time.
Apparently he is not the only one doing that, the other waiters are busy too, when we wanted to ask a waiter to help us fill up water, they pretend they did not see.
I hope Violet Oon can at least provide more staff to maintain the quality of service.

8633,Tims Restaurant & Cafe,4,"1st Visit dated on 3rd week of April 2023.

Our 1st try Nepalese food and ordered the chicken Momo and fish N chips as good reviews from netizens.

The exterior appearance really looked like the chinese xiao long bao but the texture tasted like siew mai instead. The sauce slightly spicy.
Must eat it when served hot because cold already the exterior skin hardened.

We applauded their well done fish N chips and the discounted price for senior customers.

Definitely will be back again especially to try their western food again.",2023-04-15T10:38:59.291Z,1,IVY MU,265.0,True,,,10 months ago,,Dinner,,$10‚Äì20,Dine in,4.0,4.0,5.0,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd09UZFl3EAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCL8lvSSxoSPVX2iEfylI6m5AWkAVvIQEl6YO1=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNmdVnTCb2kiQRShamPfvERSuh4VuqZ41uQuPjV=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOaUu1bcw5_6XwsLweQSletyQN3jKPPKegsPQBA=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMOpvFEAtWtZFknHRc5sPyCM53C111CaxcOkfb=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSd09UZFl3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x9db5f9664a352668!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDRwOTdYw%7CCgwIw_3poQYQuNjqigE%7C?hl=en,106022162798383449296,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJatETGmDQmT0bPSsmqYlAbRs1Nk7jdjYxkATJWj9Zh=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106022162798383449296?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,91

10136,Gaig Singapore,4,"Purveyor of high-end Catalan cuisine. The offered tasting menu purports to be an overview of the restaurant's offerings, but has some notable misses. Service is attentive, though slightly pushy, while ambience is excellent on a quiet midweek night. In all, given the variable quality of the tasting menu, I would probably recommend going for ala carte versions of dishes you are actually interested in eating.

Liked:
- Galician octopus and pork belly. Honestly the best thing we had, and is unfortunately not included in the tasting menu. I think it should be - it's an excellent and easily-portioned showcase.

- Of the tasting menu:
- Amuse bouche was suitably amusing: a shot of unseasoned yet highly fragrant mushroom stock.
- Salmorejo soup with jamon ice cream was an interesting starter, though I couldn't really taste the jamon in the ice cream.
- Of the tapas courses, the croquette and bomba were standouts, especially the surprisingly spicy and piquant sauce underlying the latter.
- Stuffed Cannelloni. The presentation (a single sad-looking cannelloni spooned over haphazardly with a thick sauce) is unappetizing, but it tastes pretty good.
- Catalan creme brulee was excellent and a satisfying end to the dinner, as were the petit fours served after as a nice gesture commemorate our special occasion.

Ambivalent:
- Of the tapas courses, the toast-based tapas (the jamon and the anchovies) had toast that was a bit too crispy - when you bite into it, the toast breaks up and gets all over the table. In the case of the jamon, because of the way the jamon is shingled, it's all too easy to end up eating a whole piece of ham with your bite of toast, so that you're left with excess toast and no ham at the end. Basically the mechanics of those dishes doesn't quite work.
- Seafood Fideu√† from the tasting menu. Carabinero prawn wasn't the freshest, and the short-cut noodles themselves had a sort of rubbery overfried texture while not being as flavorful as they looked.
- Crispy suckling pig with strawberries from the tasting menu. The suckling pig is good, if normal, but the presence of fresh strawberries strikes me as odd. Thought it would be good as a compote or something.

Disliked:
- Apple and Fennel salad, separately ordered. Honestly very meh; the one-note vegetal quality of the fennel overpowers the dish, burying the taste of the apple. A dish that doesn't really come together.",2023-12-21T09:16:06.883Z,1,Colin Chan,299.0,False,,,2 months ago,,Dinner,,$100+,Dine in,5.0,4.0,5.0,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWLTZ2ZllREAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIwASEfz8JvzTeL0HlyY-oa636gsfJGMZ1xccJ=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkKaY5j1C0xsEyPSJJDedIdTG_RP5l9ax684PL=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNeKbr7gvnantrWVxB6_BRjSyDXIcXjqr-OsZyc=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJqH4UBG89_05W2lJVCteKPnvAH-R9dTVEtcwK=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVQMeJLKhutkXqTAh7KEsItHDGYhn666mP5-cd=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrwVoWAh5m_1XpVbjQMjEPFVlyBwHt0ZcHc6Sg=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOZahRkUrcXqvUHCQGGKEPQdNy3bRz_1JPQYky=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXggR2BoWZYpMbTNcSSKEJeB1_9ljVEGx-kmVh=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKK0To0EAAIgbpJilHi41Z7W6DSJuywzxt8bIb=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWLTZ2ZllREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x6387fcf3dbbebfbe!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDV-6vfYQ%7CCgwI1oSQrAYQgKCSpQM%7C?hl=en,107951074976008996072,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJxWXJHoOnQ3_KXdWujnz0f0gX3YE9s9LPh2-xVO48F-Q=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107951074976008996072?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,408

4492,Brotzeit German Beer Bar and Restaurant - VivoCity,4,"Indulge your cravings for authentic German cuisine at Brotzeit.

3690,Rhubarb,4,"Visited in Jul 2023

The last time I had visited Rhubarb was 4-5 years ago. So a revisit was a long time coming. Good food and great service as always. There are 3 options/dining experiences you can choose from. I went for the most comprehensive one - 3 starters, 1 main with chef‚Äôs premium ingredient and 1 dessert.

While I can see how Rhubarb has been able to maintain its 1 star for so many years, I struggled a bit to find some key differentiating factor versus other French contemporary Michelin places. Good food nonetheless.

3726,Silver Shell Cafe,5,"Visit Date: 19 Nov 23

This was a busy evening at the Silver Shell Cafe. When we made the booking about 6 hours earlier, the restaurant reservation concierge was not sure if we could be seated inside. A month earlier we had a quiet dinner at the same pace but it was so warm and sultry, I did not enjoy either the ambience or the food.

Today we had opted for their buffet sitting inside and it was wonderful!
We were served by the same Thai lady who had served us a month earlier. She was very attentive and accommodating.

The Sunday theme was ""Singapore good Ol' Days"" and Boy! Was that Good!. The spread was exhaustive!
There was a salad bar, cheese, bread and charcuterie, a small spread of sushi, seafood station with clams, scallops, prawns and mussels.
At the Indian counter there was a delicious tandoori fish  along with a reasonable spread of veg and non veg options.
In the live satay station, beef and lamb satay were the best. There was a spicy sambal prawn to die for. The roasted lamb was ok. They also served a coconut chicken ( don't remember the name) which was the tastiest with rainbow coloured rice.
On another end of the hall was roasted duck, char siew, olive rice, chilli crabs and many others.I cannot even name all.
The dessert bar was quite exhaustive too. The bread pudding was very good and so was the creme brulee. The gula melaka sago was a little bland in comparison to others. There were assorted tarts cakes and fruits. The  pandan kaya and lapis cake were very good
We had shiraz to go with it all. Wine by the glass was quite comparable price-wise to any other city restaurant.
Delicious food in a great ambience. it was priceless family time.",2023-11-19T14:55:13.643Z,0,Barnali Roy,31.0,True,,,3 months ago,,Dinner,,$100+,Dine in,5.0,5.0,5.0,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsdm8ydjFBRRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRDt5gzKVYnWUPLinWb3EMWx8qFyy9jbK87opB=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNd9Qwe55r4tfa375acQuw7wzN4Mca6QcI0cwbj=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVdN0_hLLOBJ5Epiy_VPIeShC1b_3hh_B1g-Ta=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOm4Mdjstd9_1fVDgWVJphDxUMM8_HIO-SlG1G=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPokIa4gafJBX_SApN7IkcM4OhsFGYzwu_85tEh=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsdm8ydjFBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x46ac8b6c0aab7ed8!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIClvo2v1AE%7CCgwI0cPoqgYQ6Iz6sgI%7C?hl=en,108647109946352493238,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJh4qQOZhX2uKqKlscja1pEEAjG9Hzs8YzhnikXNu_Y=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108647109946352493238?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,306

3072,Teahouse By Soup Restaurant @ Century Square,3,"Food came relatively fast with the exception of the Teochew olive rice. We checked with the server multiple times regarding the order but she brushed us off with ‚Äúit takes time to steam‚Äù without even checking with the kitchen. After an hour of waiting we decided we had enough and asked to cancel the rice if it was not ready and it turned out that the kitchen did not even prepare it as there was a glitch in their system. The staff was not apologetic at all and merely said she would cancel the order while the other staff who took our order came to apologise as she did not check with the kitchen and assumed that they were preparing the food.

4710,Tapas Club,4,"A Mixed Experience at Tapas Club: Delectable Cuisine with Premium Pricing.

My visit to Tapas Club offered a culinary journey through their menu of Spanish delicacies. The Seafood and Chicken Paella impressed with its moist rice, each grain infused with the rich essence of the ocean. Equally noteworthy were the Pulled Pork Tacos, featuring meat so tender it melted in the mouth, and the Mediterranean Salad, which was a beacon of freshness.

However, despite the high-quality food, the prices at Tapas Club are on the higher end. The cost is a significant factor to consider, especially when comparable Spanish cuisine might be found elsewhere at a more affordable rate.

Ordered the Squid+pork belly hotplate, tofu kimchi stew and, rice cake (tteokbokki). Personally not a fan of the pork belly as it has a gamey taste, as do many pork belly in other places. The tofu stew was nice and homey. The rice cake dish was special, the sauce seemed different from others I have had. The rice cake also had a good bounce to it, but remained adequately soft. We were also given free flow side dishes. Enjoyed the potato salad very much!

2574,Tambi Restaurant,4,We were here to celebrate a friend‚Äôs birthday. They have 2 dining sessions for dinner. One at 6pm and the other at 8pm. Advance reservation will be needed as it‚Äôs usually booked out. We dined in the upper level. Love the design. We were hosted by raj who did an excellent job. He recommended us dishes and describe the portion size. Menu seems fusion but I feel like the dishes got abit lost in the fusion. My favourite dish was the buckweed noodles. The food was well cooked and season but my biggest let down was the pork rib biryani. Rice was dry and proportions of spice and nuts were not right. I like the idea but maybe could have been executed a little better for the price.,2023-11-21T05:16:46.241Z,0,Daryl Nonis,31.0,True,,,3 months ago,,Dinner,,$50‚Äì60,Dine in,5.0,4.0,5.0,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsOGFtYlpBEAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqqFj6-n-PWg3PqZ9dBox8Jd2g_YXP-vmQqKhF=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwhHZ9pIJIKIeQgraz5U3vhmBOg-r2Y6kykWJq=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRDj--CdrxenjToL3_2JzDSLb_F5OaCtSMEruX=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4FjI-OtiikhpORVBYoW9GDl1HnbrwlZJbAHKs=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpYEjRyeetPlP3t4zx_3SPwZs4t49RLHspfbX8=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpMeJD9remOnmiWchTLhleF8bvOzco8seE7Liv=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1xb3bx0NWdEJQUmLHKb40Yal5QQ9-RjA3842V=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-icFokfOCLhkXyEUqoKeYnCSt90WlOQtUaiTd=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8KAPnZo71SsyeSa2EH-zBvOckEW1rsHRm7TkA=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsOGFtYlpBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xb9e4767c08b217aa!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICl8ambZA%7CCgsIvvrwqgYQkJmGcw%7C?hl=en,108166350271261484467,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWVbGR3ckqznkDumZz1M4Y8d-mp6R9LkjXLxC-ZeIXW5Cg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108166350271261484467?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,128

4920,terra Tokyo Italian,5,"As with Tras street, the eateries are in abundance within the area and over here, the nice restaurants are tucked amongst the shop houses.

It was a business lunch and we went for their omakase set lunch and the chef chooses what to serve based on the pricing. We had the $208 set. Needless to say, it‚Äôs worth every penny. Every dish will be easily 8/10. We were served 6-7 dishes and you will be well fed as I was worried having to do another round of ramen along Tanjong Pagar after this session. :)

One of the highlights will be the uni that‚Äôs generously perched on the pastry puff and the caviar too.

The tuna carpaccio was decent but didn‚Äôt shine as there are two more dishes that stood out - Japanese promfret and the A4 striploin. The promfret melts in your mouth with a strong seafoody taste that anybody will die for if you‚Äôre a seafoodie.

I couldn‚Äôt remember all the sauces and condiments that accompanied all the dishes. Just too many details but they tasted wonderful and complemented each dish just so aptly.

Time : 1 pm

Celebrated my mum‚Äôs 94th birthday here. 12 of us. Preordered suckling pig and the birthday buns.

Ordered 8 dishes : 7 dishes + 1 dessert.
The suckling pig is excellent.
Fried mian xian, yam ring and roast chicken also good.
The fried watercress, Â§ßËèú the dessert yam paste orh nee soso.

Time : 6 pm

Came here again to celebrate CNY. Restaurant‚Äôs really packed to the brim, people in joyous mood.

We ordered the $738+ menu. Started with lohei as usual. The 2nd dish fish maw soup came a bit late, about 30 mins later. So everything else was being delayed.

Also a bit disorganized as tables were not grouped by type of chosen menu, so staff at times didn‚Äôt know which table to serve.

Clearly not enough manpower and staff was busy.

Roast chicken was good. Braised mushroom with spinach too and the red bean sesame ball dessert.
Steamed grouper was soso.

Date of visit : Sun 30 Oct 2022
Time : 12.45 pm

Reserved a table for 12 in advance as my mum wanted to celebrate her 93th birthday here. The whole place seemed full.

Called ahead also to order a big pomfret about 1 kg+ and also the longevity buns - a pack of 18 costing about $40.

The longevity buns look beautiful. We are reminded not to consume the big bun nor the small teeny weeny apple like decoration buns.

Service is good : some dishes are divided into equal portions for us.

The Teochew style steamed pomfret lacks the same flavor as other Teochew restaurants. The deep fried oyster omelette is so thin and crispy that it‚Äôs unlike those sold at hawker centres.

1530,Tea House by Soup Restaurant - IMM,2,"This place is easily missable, walked one whole round of level 1 and didnt notice I passed by it... its ridiculous how its camouflaged by the other stores.

Not a conducive place to chat while eating as the waiters keep clanging the cutlery when keeping the dishes and the sound just reverbs throughout the restaurant.

Would like to comment how funny it was their soup bowl is even smaller than their rice bowl, which was already small enough, about the size of a petit woman's  palm. How do you expect people to drink from the bowls with ingredients in it?

White rice was so little, served in a small lil tiny bowl.
Ordered their 2 pax chicken set on the front of the menu thinking its their signature dish but the chicken and the cucumber are horrible. Not fresh and super dry. It was 35++ for that chicken and soup. Not worth it. Paid 77 for 2 pax for the whole dinner (included an extra tray of siew mai and fried fish)

At the end noticed people only come here for the dimsum. But there are better dimsums out there.",2023-03-28T10:33:49.167Z,0,Jaclyn H.Y,71.0,True,,,11 months ago,,,,,,2.0,2.0,3.0,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocGJlVERBEAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOy-ByglpZRXyMRdbBXfF6SvpJa8HODj4q5FHbL=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiLq4NAmSOgltf9HjTAdYDA0K4zTtf_E79DK5N=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhldlfFckrcjyFAQ1WzhmuJfjfCpzIaW39IusE=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDYkRGCDc8_UIV6ZiIV0mm9LfTGwOgG4hvbx0Z=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgtsD7l4EyTVQg5qb6MhGS6kR0qOf8rGi0FvSU=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRg4G-iNCUCoP6kotCnhGyIiHi79098ke5CaiO=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocGJlVERBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xf8ef1f0c980d0603!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDhpbeTDA%7CCgsIjYWLoQYQ6NvuTw%7C?hl=en,108914695029741058952,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLd3_hNeH7mq0nRzc7SaDIsMLYsDY6q_owhCUp9DGn8Xw=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108914695029741058952?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,190

From the moment we stepped in, the ambiance was warm and inviting, setting the stage for a memorable evening - I had made a reservation for balcony seating.

We ordered each a 5 course dinner set. Each dish was a masterpiece of flavor and presentation, showcasing the culinary expertise of the chefs.

What set this restaurant apart was also their thoughtful attention to detail, especially when it came to celebrating birthdays. Not only did they provide delicious complimentary desserts, but they also went above and beyond to make the birthday celebration truly special for my wife.

Lewis & staff not only ensured that our dining experience was impeccable but took great picture and frame it up as a gift for us. He also led us to a picturesque spot nearby for some unforgettable birthday photos, and even emailed us the pictures. His hospitality truly added an extra layer of delight to our evening!

The rice shows up for our meal in minutes after ordering. We ordered seafood rice, but this has chicken in it. I questioned it and was told the seafood rice does have chicken in it? I am pescatarian so perhaps that should be indicated on the menu if it has meat. Asked about the dumplings again and we were told yea yeah they are coming. We did get the dumplings shortly after and they were mediocre at best. I requested chili oil in vein. To make this shorter, it was terrible. We never got all of the food we ordered.

I had the Earl grey lavender w strawberry to accompany my meal, which was fantastic and wasn't too sweet. The Pork Floss Tamagoyaki was so simple and yet very flavorful with every piece. The Spicy Cumin Lamb & Mushroom Udon was delicious with every mouthful and had the right amount of spice to it (the staff compared it to mala medium spiciness). The Fried Mochi Bun was a great ending to the meal with a great combination of the texture of the chewy Mochi in the center and the flavors of the bun pairing the ice cream on the side.

5827,Nam Kee Chicken Rice Restaurant,3,"Nam Kee is an 40 years old-school Hainanese chicken rice shop where it is located at Upper Thomson Road‚Ä¶.

Food:
Honestly , it is not the best Chicken Rice in town. But, they serve relative delicious Thai-Chinese Cuisines. Among my favourite dishes are Sambal Fried KangKong and Deep Fried Tofu.

Service:
The staff are quite friendly and attentive. Ok‚Ä¶ acceptable service‚Ä¶

Atmosphere:
Old school and nostalgic decoration, with its latest change perhaps the air-conditioned which was installed in the late 90s.  It quite comfortably to have my dinner here.

3091,Â∞èÊµ¶Áî∞È§êÈ¶Ü | Xiao Pu Tien Restaurant,5,"Qualifier for my ratings, particularly for the atmosphere. While it is a casual restaurant, it was clean and cool with big fans blowing when you eat so it does make you enjoy the food and company better.

Foodwise, very decent renditions of patience food, especially the staples such as the putien meefen and lor mee. Comparable to other famous putien restaurants. Where it does not fare as well would be other dishes which I think not be particularly representative of putien food, but I may be wrong...

Service was polite and prompt. Definitely worth a visit if you stay in the east and craves for putien food. Price wise, acceptable for the settings.

There was pork floss sprinkled over the kailan which was unusual for us, as it made the dish too sweet. The prawn paste chicken lacked flavour, tasting like it was fried in reused oil. Maybe we caught them on a bad day as the other reviews seem pretty decent.

504,Vineyard,4,"Perfect evening and food. Service can be improved.

Scallops $22, 4/5 - frozen variety but done well. Leek was hard to chew.

Pink oyster mushrooms $14, 4.5/5 - something like battered mushroom fries, perfectly fried (oily) but thinly crisped. This dish came late.

Veal brisket $36, 3/5 - meat did not pack any taste. It was a bit tough, but could be pulled apart. Jus/mash was tasty but could have been a bit more concentrated.

Tuna steak tartare $20, 4.5/5 - quite a perfect rendition, tartare scooped onto a flower pie tie cup. Four servings but adequate as a main in my opinion. Could have been more chilled if intended to serve cold.

Bombe alaska $28, 4/5 - mostly for show. Inside was dark choc ice cream, outside was caked in meringue and sponge. Tasted below average but the fire was a nice performance.

Cocktails were $16-18. Negroni and tequila sunrise were decent.

House pour sparkling wine $12 - quite impressive. Well chilled and serving size was nice.

Service: We came under a reservation which had an anniversary note (Chope), but when we arrived, the staff did not ask if we were under a reservation, and just gave us a table for 2. Luckily i did not have Chope vouchers or promos to use.

I ordered pink oyster mushrooms as a starter, though on menu it was a side, and ordered the tuna tartare as my main, which on menu was a starter. This, the waiter did not understand. I ended up receiving my oyster mushrooms at the same time my partner received his main.

Essentially the waiter served my partners starter (scallops) and then asked me if my oyster mushrooms was my starter and then that the kitchen would prepare it. Quite disappointed at this but they can only learn.",2024-01-01T02:11:07.437Z,0,Gaius Leong,142.0,True,,,2 months ago,,Dinner,,$100+,Dine in,5.0,4.0,3.0,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNWMFB5aW5RRRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOa3EgvA1M0aAzoUXkJL3QLIDCzNNO9vzTjq0ON=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuEB5a0RhfVuTxKiaSXP5Sr2RCRqffrlFEteQO=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGy3se6LcI1FMXPuDfdD1EZ7SGYjQ-4FRSLnCN=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGhqn_zI4ZGDZJNEAMGdkiD52fB3nDPBqYYOrU=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpYoBVLGXyRqkfbSZKqrQrq7AYHRysIYV0WXJl=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLesXDYifowtgP7EzufV6Y9i2eMmoYuYq5n6QP=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgLyLtnkvQwWkunKkOFJAvZVdX9FOdi9ajR_86=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNf8KjhJX3vfsehew9MxGhD8ib7y7B78Rq94p5M=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8lzrwFH-cEmPCx3_DTKaXK3ugVaa5LO7Fvdsk=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNq4_hZ_04Hv9zGByB5Qwdbg5tn5P9dbacURGWO=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNWMFB5aW5RRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x271642a312e8d688!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICV0PyinQE%7CCgwIu77IrAYQyJbF0AE%7C?hl=en,114489108093874269886,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWeNOEcorY3AyX2xbTD-6VaNO5CoImi1OtIKtHZhpCayXOK=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114489108093874269886?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,301

Was very pleased with the super cold Aircon and ambience.

Smokeless charcoal BBQ equipment was very effective

Only had 2 dishes as we were not so hungry.

Side dishes were the usual fanfare but very appetising.

Had the BBQ beef kalbi
Beef was so fresh and tender.
Really worth a try.

And soy bean paste soup.
Was super umami, surprised to find so much crab and clams in it.

The service was super awesome.

The ÈÖ∏ËèúÈ±º was also very savoury and generous in portion, but may be a little fishy for some people.",2022-01-31T04:32:26.426Z,5,Jonneh Ng,8.0,False,,,2 years ago,,,,,,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNGNMTlRBEAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMNYTSH1fn1jYsbJJbI3ev2wJBDjLhPBlswAWi=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipND_nwtakZ3h3Ox3bHgr_-mn1UlD7nln04LzV6x=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcHLdAAnwCMdUqMfPlN7WgpBBL-aK9qryasphI=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPk7p52n14tlrZVe9pKoHGlL2JFw5MfFisUrVbN=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNGNMTlRBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x2d1932385944f3ca!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDm4cLNTA%7CCgwI5czdjwYQ4L3moQI%7C?hl=en,112089591783200244296,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJIJaSL088akXA83UatS1YJD19N8UJZ2GhHL93vpawx=s120-c-rp-mo-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112089591783200244296?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,58
9498,Mendon Bedok Mall,5,"a small cozy nook beside Tori-Q that serves really amazing dons!! I have been back here sooo many times to eat the salmon hotate don which never disappoints. Sashimi was super fresh and tastes really good while still remaining affordable. Really good for a nice meal out with friends.

Prices here are all nett, so no service charge! They also haven‚Äôt raised prices since GST went up to 8% so kudos to the owner for making their food so fresh and affordable for all those looking for good-tasting Japanese food.",2023-11-05T10:49:49.070Z,0,Xing Yi Han,5.0,False,,,4 months ago,,Dinner,,$10‚Äì20,Dine in,5.0,5.0,5.0,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURGeXZMWjNRRRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOefwmlsY-U23FTQccXrlmZMGrdZRPR_6_y5_ps=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-BaHIIpOTUo7gvF6-Hgwzm8Vb-3VTfElthxgE=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURGeXZMWjNRRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x3598dc7a05d026f1!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDFyvLZ3QE%7CCgsIzeadqgYQ2OW0IQ%7C?hl=en,117265714450895656365,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUdoCx03ykvhkEUTzdgbWfoBL6Run0jFENfhTE7eqmqotg=s120-c-rp-mo-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117265714450895656365?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,90
