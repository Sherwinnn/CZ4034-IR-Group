5192,Sona's Grill Restaurant,4,"Food is generally good. Serving size on the small end. Mutton, bind and palak paneer are good.  Butter chicken is a bit too sweet.  Naan is a bit thin, thus butter Naan feels oily throughout.  Gulab Jamun is dry and flaky for the first serving but the second serving was normal. So, quality is not consistent. Mango lassi is also small and overpriced.  Pricing comparable to other Indian restaurant. Waiter is attentive.

4710,Tapas Club,4,"A Mixed Experience at Tapas Club: Delectable Cuisine with Premium Pricing.

My visit to Tapas Club offered a culinary journey through their menu of Spanish delicacies. The Seafood and Chicken Paella impressed with its moist rice, each grain infused with the rich essence of the ocean. Equally noteworthy were the Pulled Pork Tacos, featuring meat so tender it melted in the mouth, and the Mediterranean Salad, which was a beacon of freshness.

However, despite the high-quality food, the prices at Tapas Club are on the higher end. The cost is a significant factor to consider, especially when comparable Spanish cuisine might be found elsewhere at a more affordable rate.

Given the sparse customer turnout during a weekday lunch, it does raise the question of whether Tapas Club might review their pricing strategy to enhance their appeal, especially if they wish to draw a larger crowd during typically slower business hours.",2023-11-07T04:46:20.691Z,2,Joe Yap,45.0,True,2023-11-28T03:16:56.757Z,,4 months ago,,Lunch,,$80–90,Dine in,4.0,5.0,4.0,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURGOXNEX0xREAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKtof814lr5nCXV5oSe_v6yZ7iBfjdKtTxjuqn=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7-I0FraUmxPRvVoV8cWorOFiVR1r79_FmRt6b=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODG1eIt-9HkCKqfficMtOR51AMxdotlYDwm3--=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjTMbM28Tdgbg_EKzGgBHWLyiQpXzWY3gS_p1y=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURGOXNEX0xREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xf8c9faa4113497ca!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDF9sD_LQ%7CCgwInIKnqgYQ-LbByQI%7C?hl=en,111833439200984936772,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWRqD4XmzOR5jnhERltw76t3qSbu5muB3yf7AUqtiT1mm4=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111833439200984936772?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,150

1285,Parker Korean Restaurant,4,"Went on a weekend dinner time, crowd started streaming in around 6-7pm, but there were still enough seats. Seem like the restaurant is managed by 2 staff + a chef (?) but still very efficient.

Ordered the Squid+pork belly hotplate, tofu kimchi stew and, rice cake (tteokbokki). Personally not a fan of the pork belly as it has a gamey taste, as do many pork belly in other places. The tofu stew was nice and homey. The rice cake dish was special, the sauce seemed different from others I have had. The rice cake also had a good bounce to it, but remained adequately soft. We were also given free flow side dishes. Enjoyed the potato salad very much!

Service wise, nothing short of stellar. Every time I’m here, Ann gives good recommendations on food choices. However, today in particular, I brought the family (including a newborn baby) and Ann was particularly attentive and considerate to our needs. She even made special arrangements for my baby boy.

2574,Tambi Restaurant,4,We were here to celebrate a friend’s birthday. They have 2 dining sessions for dinner. One at 6pm and the other at 8pm. Advance reservation will be needed as it’s usually booked out. We dined in the upper level. Love the design. We were hosted by raj who did an excellent job. He recommended us dishes and describe the portion size. Menu seems fusion but I feel like the dishes got abit lost in the fusion. My favourite dish was the buckweed noodles. The food was well cooked and season but my biggest let down was the pork rib biryani. Rice was dry and proportions of spice and nuts were not right. I like the idea but maybe could have been executed a little better for the price.,2023-11-21T05:16:46.241Z,0,Daryl Nonis,31.0,True,,,3 months ago,,Dinner,,$50–60,Dine in,5.0,4.0,5.0,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsOGFtYlpBEAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqqFj6-n-PWg3PqZ9dBox8Jd2g_YXP-vmQqKhF=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwhHZ9pIJIKIeQgraz5U3vhmBOg-r2Y6kykWJq=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRDj--CdrxenjToL3_2JzDSLb_F5OaCtSMEruX=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4FjI-OtiikhpORVBYoW9GDl1HnbrwlZJbAHKs=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpYEjRyeetPlP3t4zx_3SPwZs4t49RLHspfbX8=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpMeJD9remOnmiWchTLhleF8bvOzco8seE7Liv=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1xb3bx0NWdEJQUmLHKb40Yal5QQ9-RjA3842V=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-icFokfOCLhkXyEUqoKeYnCSt90WlOQtUaiTd=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8KAPnZo71SsyeSa2EH-zBvOckEW1rsHRm7TkA=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsOGFtYlpBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xb9e4767c08b217aa!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICl8ambZA%7CCgsIvvrwqgYQkJmGcw%7C?hl=en,108166350271261484467,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWVbGR3ckqznkDumZz1M4Y8d-mp6R9LkjXLxC-ZeIXW5Cg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108166350271261484467?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,128

1483,Greenwood Fish Market,3,"Their fried food are quite good. However their sushi are not very fresh. Servers are very friendly. Another downside is that there are birds flying to the tables and kitchen where they prepare the food, making it quite unsanitary and the service crew seem unfazed by them. Weirdly, don’t see this issue at the neighbouring restaurants.

Aburi salmon maki - not very fresh, can skip

Fish and chip - they use catfish making it very soft and have the melt in the mouth effect. The batter they use for both the fries and fish are very crispy

4920,terra Tokyo Italian,5,"As with Tras street, the eateries are in abundance within the area and over here, the nice restaurants are tucked amongst the shop houses.

It was a business lunch and we went for their omakase set lunch and the chef chooses what to serve based on the pricing. We had the $208 set. Needless to say, it’s worth every penny. Every dish will be easily 8/10. We were served 6-7 dishes and you will be well fed as I was worried having to do another round of ramen along Tanjong Pagar after this session. :)

One of the highlights will be the uni that’s generously perched on the pastry puff and the caviar too.

The tuna carpaccio was decent but didn’t shine as there are two more dishes that stood out - Japanese promfret and the A4 striploin. The promfret melts in your mouth with a strong seafoody taste that anybody will die for if you’re a seafoodie.

I couldn’t remember all the sauces and condiments that accompanied all the dishes. Just too many details but they tasted wonderful and complemented each dish just so aptly.

Time : 1 pm

Celebrated my mum’s 94th birthday here. 12 of us. Preordered suckling pig and the birthday buns.

Ordered 8 dishes : 7 dishes + 1 dessert.
The suckling pig is excellent.
Fried mian xian, yam ring and roast chicken also good.
The fried watercress, 大菜 the dessert yam paste orh nee soso.

Date of visit : Sat 21 Jan 2023
Time : 6 pm

Came here again to celebrate CNY. Restaurant’s really packed to the brim, people in joyous mood.

We ordered the $738+ menu. Started with lohei as usual. The 2nd dish fish maw soup came a bit late, about 30 mins later. So everything else was being delayed.

Also a bit disorganized as tables were not grouped by type of chosen menu, so staff at times didn’t know which table to serve.

Clearly not enough manpower and staff was busy.

Roast chicken was good. Braised mushroom with spinach too and the red bean sesame ball dessert.
Steamed grouper was soso.

Date of visit : Sun 30 Oct 2022
Time : 12.45 pm

Reserved a table for 12 in advance as my mum wanted to celebrate her 93th birthday here. The whole place seemed full.

Called ahead also to order a big pomfret about 1 kg+ and also the longevity buns - a pack of 18 costing about $40.

The longevity buns look beautiful. We are reminded not to consume the big bun nor the small teeny weeny apple like decoration buns.

Service is good : some dishes are divided into equal portions for us.

The Teochew style steamed pomfret lacks the same flavor as other Teochew restaurants. The deep fried oyster omelette is so thin and crispy that it’s unlike those sold at hawker centres.

1530,Tea House by Soup Restaurant - IMM,2,"This place is easily missable, walked one whole round of level 1 and didnt notice I passed by it... its ridiculous how its camouflaged by the other stores.

Not a conducive place to chat while eating as the waiters keep clanging the cutlery when keeping the dishes and the sound just reverbs throughout the restaurant.

Would like to comment how funny it was their soup bowl is even smaller than their rice bowl, which was already small enough, about the size of a petit woman's  palm. How do you expect people to drink from the bowls with ingredients in it?

White rice was so little, served in a small lil tiny bowl.
Ordered their 2 pax chicken set on the front of the menu thinking its their signature dish but the chicken and the cucumber are horrible. Not fresh and super dry. It was 35++ for that chicken and soup. Not worth it. Paid 77 for 2 pax for the whole dinner (included an extra tray of siew mai and fried fish)

At the end noticed people only come here for the dimsum.

I ordered a 20 piece nugget meal takeaway that comes with 4 tubs of curry sauce but to my utmost dismay, when I got home, I was met with 0 tubs of curry sauce.

7178,Kelly Jie Seafood (TPY Mellben Seafood) 龍海鲜螃蟹王,5,"Excellent services, celebrating mum's birthday here. Staffs here are all very friendly and helpful, from ordering to serving to cake cutting, they even sing the bday song together with us👍.. Food here are great, craypot crab with vermicelli is the best especially the soup, chilli crab came with bit of spiciness best to eat with their mantou, 冰镇咕噜肉 surprises us as its really crispy with slight cool on the outside but hot when u bite onto it, their truffles salad is one of their signature, great presentation with dry ice effect. Their 富贵鸡 is also a must try, full of ingredients like sea cucumbers, sea asparagus, scallops, fish maws and slices of Abalone, the chicken is really tender and flavourful, goes really well with juz white rice alone.

What set this restaurant apart was also their thoughtful attention to detail, especially when it came to celebrating birthdays. Not only did they provide delicious complimentary desserts, but they also went above and beyond to make the birthday celebration truly special for my wife.

Lewis & staff not only ensured that our dining experience was impeccable but took great picture and frame it up as a gift for us. He also led us to a picturesque spot nearby for some unforgettable birthday photos, and even emailed us the pictures. His hospitality truly added an extra layer of delight to our evening!

Friendly place. Decent food and drinks options.
They are open till midnight but last order is around 22:30.

Although the menu is good, the food is quite alright . I’d prefer them to work on the mint chutney, as it wasn’t very authentic. The chilli-pakoras are must try though.
Pool tables are available for pay-to-play.
Toilets are clean.
They have outdoor options.

5479,Da Luca Italian Restaurant,4,"Was recommended to dine here, I must say I was rather impressed by the quality and portion.  All our orders are well divided before being brought to us, portion was really generous and filling.

Really love the truffle uni capellini, and the service standards of service staff. Tiramisu (baileys) gals alittle short of my expectation and I feel can be better, but otherwise the rest of the food were great!

10131,Chinatown Seafood Restaurant,1,"Waited in line to eat here. When it was our turn, we were led to a bar in the back of another area across the street. We ordered 2 beers and dumplings… 5 min passed. The couple next to us (that was sat after us) got their beers. They ordered dinner, 10 minutes passed. Still no beers. Finally flagged down the host and he brought our beers. We asked the server about the dumplings and he said they were coming so we ordered dinner. The rice shows up for our meal in minutes after ordering. We ordered seafood rice, but this has chicken in it. I questioned it and was told the seafood rice does have chicken in it? I am pescatarian so perhaps that should be indicated on the menu if it has meat. Asked about the dumplings again and we were told yea yeah they are coming. We did get the dumplings shortly after and they were mediocre at best. I requested chili oil in vein. To make this shorter, it was terrible. We never got all of the food we ordered. (The table next to us never got ANY food) We had to argue so that they would take the food that we never received off. This was a restaurant full of unhappy guests and extremely confused servers.

Value for money food
Homely environment, gives the feeling as if you are attending a function where the food has been cooked at home and being served by the host on banana leaves !
The fish head curry is one of the best in Singapore !
The chicken , prawn and mutton preparations are tasty as well !
Comes with endless servings of rice and lovely condiments till you are bursting at seams !
Try the awesome Teh Halia (Ginger milk tea) or any other freshly made house pour !
There’s outdoors and indoors seating ! Outdoors provides a nice view of the greenery around !
The staff have amazing memories, no pen paper , and all orders are taken by “brain work” and service is delivered without mistakes and with lot of care ! They are very helpful and patient in assisting with ordering as well and will not misguide or make you over order !

10624,Jū Kyū Restaurant & Bar,5,"Decided on the 4 course lunch set without regrets! The staff were very attentive and helpful for orders along with the recommendations. Everything the staff recommended was delicious and glad I listened.

I had the Earl grey lavender w strawberry to accompany my meal, which was fantastic and wasn't too sweet. The Pork Floss Tamagoyaki was so simple and yet very flavorful with every piece. The Spicy Cumin Lamb & Mushroom Udon was delicious with every mouthful and had the right amount of spice to it (the staff compared it to mala medium spiciness). The Fried Mochi Bun was a great ending to the meal with a great combination of the texture of the chewy Mochi in the center and the flavors of the bun pairing the ice cream on the side.

The music at the place was also not too loud and had very chill vibes which compliments the environment itself of the restaurant/bar.

5827,Nam Kee Chicken Rice Restaurant,3,"Nam Kee is an 40 years old-school Hainanese chicken rice shop where it is located at Upper Thomson Road….

Food:
Honestly , it is not the best Chicken Rice in town. But, they serve relative delicious Thai-Chinese Cuisines. Among my favourite dishes are Sambal Fried KangKong and Deep Fried Tofu.

Service:
The staff are quite friendly and attentive. Ok… acceptable service…

Atmosphere:
Old school and nostalgic decoration, with its latest change perhaps the air-conditioned which was installed in the late 90s.  It quite comfortably to have my dinner here.

Verdict:
I quite like the texture of chicken breast - soft and tender.

3091,小浦田餐馆 | Xiao Pu Tien Restaurant,5,"Qualifier for my ratings, particularly for the atmosphere. While it is a casual restaurant, it was clean and cool with big fans blowing when you eat so it does make you enjoy the food and company better.

Foodwise, very decent renditions of patience food, especially the staples such as the putien meefen and lor mee. Comparable to other famous putien restaurants. Where it does not fare as well would be other dishes which I think not be particularly representative of putien food, but I may be wrong...

Service was polite and prompt. Definitely worth a visit if you stay in the east and craves for putien food. Price wise, acceptable for the settings.

Today was real disappointment as the sambal stingray wasn't BBQ enuf and totally not authentic. The sambal was sweet and not spicy at the least! The claypot tofu has only 6 pc of small tofu and can tell its ore cooked then pour in claypot. I am expecting claypot sizzle.

There was pork floss sprinkled over the kailan which was unusual for us, as it made the dish too sweet. The prawn paste chicken lacked flavour, tasting like it was fried in reused oil. Maybe we caught them on a bad day as the other reviews seem pretty decent.

2340,Tangerine,5,Without a doubt the best meal I ate in my entire time in Singapore. This was despite the fact that I was eating from a set menu which perhaps didn't represent my natural taste.

Staff were impeccable and of course one is looking out on the beautiful tropical surroundings of Espa.

504,Vineyard,4,"Perfect evening and food. Service can be improved.

Scallops $22, 4/5 - frozen variety but done well. Leek was hard to chew.

Pink oyster mushrooms $14, 4.5/5 - something like battered mushroom fries, perfectly fried (oily) but thinly crisped. This dish came late.

Veal brisket $36, 3/5 - meat did not pack any taste. It was a bit tough, but could be pulled apart. Jus/mash was tasty but could have been a bit more concentrated.

Tuna steak tartare $20, 4.5/5 - quite a perfect rendition, tartare scooped onto a flower pie tie cup. Four servings but adequate as a main in my opinion. Could have been more chilled if intended to serve cold.

Bombe alaska $28, 4/5 - mostly for show. Inside was dark choc ice cream, outside was caked in meringue and sponge. Tasted below average but the fire was a nice performance.

Cocktails were $16-18. Negroni and tequila sunrise were decent.

House pour sparkling wine $12 - quite impressive. Well chilled and serving size was nice.

Service: We came under a reservation which had an anniversary note (Chope), but when we arrived, the staff did not ask if we were under a reservation, and just gave us a table for 2. Luckily i did not have Chope vouchers or promos to use.

I ordered pink oyster mushrooms as a starter, though on menu it was a side, and ordered the tuna tartare as my main, which on menu was a starter. This, the waiter did not understand. I ended up receiving my oyster mushrooms at the same time my partner received his main.

Essentially the waiter served my partners starter (scallops) and then asked me if my oyster mushrooms was my starter and then that the kitchen would prepare it. Quite disappointed at this but they can only learn.",2024-01-01T02:11:07.437Z,0,Gaius Leong,142.0,True,,,2 months ago,,Dinner,,$100+,Dine in,5.0,4.0,3.0,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNWMFB5aW5RRRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOa3EgvA1M0aAzoUXkJL3QLIDCzNNO9vzTjq0ON=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuEB5a0RhfVuTxKiaSXP5Sr2RCRqffrlFEteQO=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGy3se6LcI1FMXPuDfdD1EZ7SGYjQ-4FRSLnCN=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGhqn_zI4ZGDZJNEAMGdkiD52fB3nDPBqYYOrU=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpYoBVLGXyRqkfbSZKqrQrq7AYHRysIYV0WXJl=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLesXDYifowtgP7EzufV6Y9i2eMmoYuYq5n6QP=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgLyLtnkvQwWkunKkOFJAvZVdX9FOdi9ajR_86=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNf8KjhJX3vfsehew9MxGhD8ib7y7B78Rq94p5M=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8lzrwFH-cEmPCx3_DTKaXK3ugVaa5LO7Fvdsk=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNq4_hZ_04Hv9zGByB5Qwdbg5tn5P9dbacURGWO=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNWMFB5aW5RRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x271642a312e8d688!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICV0PyinQE%7CCgwIu77IrAYQyJbF0AE%7C?hl=en,114489108093874269886,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWeNOEcorY3AyX2xbTD-6VaNO5CoImi1OtIKtHZhpCayXOK=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114489108093874269886?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,301

Had the BBQ beef kalbi
Beef was so fresh and tender.
Really worth a try.

And soy bean paste soup.
Was super umami, surprised to find so much crab and clams in it.

The service was super awesome.
