3766,Element Restaurant Amara Singapore,1,"Came this evening (15/02/24) for a valentine date. Very disappointed in the food and service here. Initially saw it on TikTok when some influencer promoted it, it looked good there. Now I understand, maybe it was a paid promotion.

First of all, the atmosphere is not the best. Tables were placed very close to one another. When you walk in, it just doesn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre walking into a hotel standard buffet.

Then the service, the man at the sashimi bar was rude. When we ask for the sashimi, we are greeted with ‚Äúwhat you want?!‚Äù In a very rude manner and they way he communicates with the customers is not nice. However, the staffs were fast to clear our used plates on the table and were borderline friendly.

Last, the food. The sushi doesn‚Äôt taste very fresh and of good quality. Same can be said for their snow crab legs, it wasn‚Äôt as fresh. The meat was rather dry and tasteless. I did not eat any of the raw food as I‚Äôm allergic, therefore no comments on the sashimi, mussels.

The cooked food was below average. It includes the self serve rojak station, roast pork, roast chicken, ghor hiang, herbal duck, stir fry pork and grilled chicken.

The acceptable cook food that was pretty good was their fried bee Hoon & chicken satay. Those were pretty yummy.

The WORST dish there was the Chilli crab. Now I don‚Äôt expect Tzar Char standard but it wasn‚Äôt even close. The crabs were extremely small, the meat was so dark in colour and it breaks apart so easily. It felt like the crab was stored for a long time. It taste very very bad. The sauce was okay with the mantou.

Overall, I would not pay 98++ (dinner) for a buffet of this standard.

6384,Sankranti Restaurant,1,"Ordered mutton bryani.
Food was cold! Top part was hot bottom part was cold!

Whole restaurant only 3-5 people when i vist at around 4.35pm on 1jan2024.

The first thing the service staff tell me is no more food. Only left mutton bryani which is the food i wanted to eat.
He doesnt seem to be interested as i was not done with my order. I had to call him before he left after serving another family to follow up on my order.
And prior to my order he didnt even bother to give us a menu and insisted only left bryani and we had to ask for drinks menu to catch some of the drinks that are supposedly still available.

Food had 1 small hair on my yogurt! Can see in photo! Very hard to spot.

My wife had advised me not to visit as the review is bad and as a fan of indian food i couldn‚Äôt help myself but go against her advise.

Atmosphere at the cashier have a strong stench smell. The cashier girl only pass us the bank receipt at first, we had to ask for the food receipt then she give us.

7281,Samy's Curry Restaurant,4,"Samy‚Äôs Curry in Dempsey stands apart with a distinctive ambiance, diverging from the sophisticated, fine-dining feel of its neighboring restaurants. Instead, it embraces a canteen-like atmosphere adorned with an 80s colonial setting, offering a nostalgic journey through time.

As a family-owned establishment, the culinary highlights include the fish head curry, squid, and fish bergedil (fried fish and potato cutlet). Served in a generous pot, the fish head curry captivates with its spicy, tangy profile, enriched with curry powder, tomatoes, tamarind, and a subtle sweetness. The marinated squid delights with its moist tenderness, while the fish bergedil boasts a pleasing texture and aromatic appeal. Unfortunately, there weren‚Äôt many vegetarian options to choose from.

Have to drop one star because of the sanitary conditions of the place. As it‚Äôs a really small establishment, everything seems very cramped and a few times I have to walk like a crab just to get back to my table.

Floor was sticky at most areas and towards the back of the shop it was wet with grey most stains all over. Imagine a wet market walkway. You‚Äôll get the drift.

2607,Annalakshmi Restaurant,3,"Food was excellent and tasty. Although many years ago at the Havelock branch the food have more variety and taste better. I think that it is because of the ""pay as you like concept"", most people do not pay a lot. That is why the number of dish are lesser now and more cost effective dish are served. This makes sense because rental and staff are not cheap for them too. I read through the review and there are some complain about customer service. Personally I do feel it and get what they mean. I don't feel very comfortable eating there, this is the first time I feel this way in a restaurant. Maybe because of the ""pay as you like concept"", and most people don't pay a lot. The feeling is like you are there for a free meal. It is a nice place and I like the food there, I rather that they charge a fix price for the buffet rather than the ""pay as you like concept"". Maybe their 3rd floor can have a buffet corner where they charge a fix price. And people will be more comfortable there.

It was an interesting experience to see the service staff prepared and cooked right in front of us. Next time we would do it ourselves for experience.

The Okonomiyaki has 3 indigents of our choice but were kind of overpowered by the cabbage and sauce favour.

1471,Greenwood Fish Market,2,"Went for our Anniversary Celebration yesterday night at Greenwood Fish Market @Quayside Isle. Overall food was good and we love the environment and atmosphere but was disappointed there are no more Resident discount.

Me and my family have been a loyal customer of this restaurant for quite some time, and I've always appreciated the discount provided to Sentosa Cove Residents. However, during my yesterday visit, I was surprised to learn that the discount policy had changed, and the staff's communication about this adjustment was rather disappointing. The person I spoke to seemed uninterested in addressing my concerns and exhibited a somewhat rude attitude. I've always valued the positive experiences I've had here, and the change in policy coupled with the unfriendly encounter left me feeling disheartened. I believe that clear communication about policy changes is crucial, and it would be beneficial for the staff to approach such matters with a more customer-friendly demeanor. I hope the management considers these aspects for the benefit of both loyal patrons and the overall reputation of the establishment.",2023-12-16T05:33:52.552Z,0,Denese Ng,4.0,False,,,2 months ago,,Dinner,,$60‚Äì70,Dine in,5.0,4.0,3.0,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWeTdfaU5BEAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtgibw8y4eORnDkJi3J3bOqR4aEVRY9IyeYq2-=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPPZxLH6A7k8LCMqkuRX-NOIf7thf_6adg2kpS=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWeTdfaU5BEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x163a2ba9236f11bd!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDVy7_iNA%7CCgwIwO30qwYQqL6vhwI%7C?hl=en,111259062946323125663,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJjsvKfBMyf1EznAYnZu4QJOA3XcU5xC6UrDIprI79t=s120-c-rp-mo-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111259062946323125663?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,174
2005,Noyah La Maison,4,"They are having a promotional breakfast set that costs $6.90 for a main and a drink. I was expecting the portion to be small and so I ordered the salted egg mayo croissant as a second main. But boy, was I very wrong. The portions are decent for an individual. The food tastes good too, and I especially love the achar like salad that comes with the croissant - it helps to get the appetite going. The laksa gravy is rich, which probably explains why they pair it with yellow noodles. It would have been better if they serve traditional Southeast Asian type of coffee instead of cappuccino or lattes.

1676,Tim Ho Wan,2,"I decided to check out Tim Ho Wan at Jewel for their National Day specials. The restaurant is decorated with a Hong Kong cafe style. Functional. The customer service is average. We ordered the fish porridge, abalone chicken tart, deep fried chili crab spring roll, steam chili crab bun, char siew Chan Bao. The porridge is good. So is their signature char siew Chan bao. As for the rest, it is forgettable. The taste is flat and bland. The spring roll is too oily and I could savor any chili crab sauce in it. The steam bun is also sparse.

They was a good variety of dishes with my favourite being the ÂúüË±Ü‰∏ù (Stir-fried Shredded Potato) in this starter. There was also a giant Ëç∑Âè∂È•≠ (Lotus Leaf Wrapped Rice) towards the end of the course which everyone had a hard time finishing. The staff are nice but perhaps a little too casual and sometimes rough when serving - bumping into things and attendees. I was quite surprised when one of them just poured the leftover peanuts onto the plate I was eating from. It was also crazy cold and parents had to keep carrying their babies outside to warm up.,2018-12-19T01:57:42.798Z,0,Kelita Yeo,47.0,True,,,5 years ago,,,,,,,,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJeUw2dnNBRRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVaMApfacGS1hOwVBeqbo2muekygD9tG5MhH47=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtOBuMLPVc1esDVLdnIln3dR2kWqmQsAbtZPpH=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJeUw2dnNBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xbf10b39fb7b43e3a!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDIyL6vsAE%7CCgwIlsvm4AUQk5Hk_AI%7C?hl=en,101846300661262663905,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXOvuQGpkaBth1k0YBFOdAisU5gJlJ3zZ1VN3Rc1Pf4RRA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101846300661262663905?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,122

5587,Pixy Restaurant & Bar,4,"This was my first time at Pixy Restaurant.

The food were all made from the freshest ingredients, with seasonal flavours. The chef (boss) is extremely friendly, and the sole waitress complemented him very well, as a dynamic duo.

The Sakoshi Bay Oysters were extremely fresh and the Sashimi Carpaccio was immaculately grilled on the outside, while  juicy and tender inside.

Their Kagoshima Wagyu Beef A5 steak was accompanied by an exciting array of vegetables and sides.

1924,Suzuki Restaurant,5,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Restaurant Suzuki.  It was truly an exceptional culinary experience. From the moment I stepped inside, I was captivated by the restaurant's elegant interior, which perfectly set the stage for what would be an unforgettable experience.

There were many highlights to the meal. One of my favorite was the aburi sushi, especially the kinmedai sushi.  The perfectly seared fish was expertly prepared with the precision that only a fine dining establishment can offer. What made this dish truly exceptional was the ingenious use of shouldering wood, infusing the fish with a delicate, smoky flavor that danced on the palate. It was a masterclass in culinary artistry, a delicate balance of technique and creativity.

Another favorite was the beef dish. The beef was cooked to perfection and melts in your mouth.

The entire omakase journey was a symphony of flavors and textures, each course thoughtfully curated to showcase the finest ingredients and the chef's extraordinary talent. The attentive and knowledgeable staff added to the overall experience, guiding us through the courses with grace and expertise.

This restaurant has undoubtedly earned its place among the finest dining establishments in the realm of Japanese cuisine.

Paired with Sultana Pulao, Mirchi Paratha, and Plain Kulcha, it was a perfect match and made me eat one plate after another.

The negative side that the management would like to improve on will be letting the diners enjoy our meals instead of rushing us off. We felt so stressed when we were not even done with our meals, the staff came over to clear away all the plates. This is very obvious chasing us off, just for the others in the queue to come in.

They said lobster are from Maine, but texture definitely different.
In Maine, lobster meat size are bigger and texture is a bit chewy springy which i love.
Luke Lobster meat is similar to Indonesia's lobster texture.
A tad to hard side without springiness.
It is still the best one so far, none competitor.
But compared to Maine lobster roll, average.
I've had way better Lobster roll in Maine.

1) the ramen soup was very salty. ( I don't know if it's my personal opinion, but this is the saltiest soup I've ever tasted.)

2) Dessert is served together with the food. By the time I've finished my ramen,my ice cream have already melted. ( From my experience dining in other restaurants, usually after u had finished your meal, then you request the staff for your dessert)

3) Hot tea is served in a porcelain cup, which make it too hot to even hold it. ( I could only able to drink it after it became cool tea üò≠)

If all the above can be improved,I don't mind coming again. If not, this might be my last time dining here again.",2024-03-05T11:23:38.267Z,0,Fion Law,4.0,False,2024-03-06T04:47:06.142Z,,2 days ago,,,,,Dine in,4.0,2.0,4.0,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5MXMtQ2FBEAE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5MXMtQ2FBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x387704b73d495bb4!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIC91s-CaA%7CCgsIuoGcrwYQqJ6xfw%7C?hl=en,107109249866701118254,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLfIzlZJtCTxcjfqw_l170_D9SrcBv6m6CUABAZzRAx=s120-c-rp-mo-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107109249866701118254?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,158

9926,Sin Ho (Block 16 Bedok South),1,"Good choice of dishes but very poor cooking. The pork slices in our ginger pork dish were cold, only the gravy was hot. The meat must have been pre-cooked, don't know how long ago, and the gravy simply warmed up and spread over the meat. Our order came super fast after placing order.
Another dish, black bean bittergourd was served much later and was piping hot and presented what we expected - food cooked to our order, not pre-cooked and warmed to serve.
So, it's your luck if you order common popular dishes which ingredients are prepped ahead and cooked en-mass with other customers' orders.
Dishes were very salty with lots of lard and oil. Cannot tell them less salt and no lard - staff taking orders told you it's no use, the cook won't care and could not be bothered.

4025,Swensen's @ Clementi Mall,1,"Food - Decent. A little overpriced considering the portion size and flavour. My burger was served on a wooden board that looked a little mouldy. (picture attached, you be the judge) The icecream seemed to have shrunk in size over the years, and was already melted on the outside by the time it arrived on the table.
Service - The male waiter that seated us was really polite and friendly. Was apologetic when we realised one of the chairs and the floor below it was wet. The other male waiter (who seemed to be the manager) we interacted with was really rude and impatient (the restaurant was not busy) when we were ordering our icecream. There was also a mix up with orders a few times, and we had food/drinks sent to our table by mistake. Other than that, service was pretty quick in terms of us getting our orders.
Atmosphere - Nice restaurant with a good view. However, since this is a family restaurant, there will be screaming kids from time to time.

10533,Restaurant Born,5,"Restaurant Born: A Culinary Masterpiece Unveiled

From the moment we first encountered the unique touch of Chef Zor Tan at Restaurant Andre, it was evident that a distinctive culinary voice was waiting to be fully expressed. We've had the privilege of experiencing the inaugural menu and the second menu at Born and both were excellent. Every dish not only captivated our senses but also unveiled the depth of passion and innovation that underpins the chef's journey.

Born's ambiance masterfully intertwines a welcoming warmth with sophisticated elegance, a testament to their meticulous attention to detail. The impeccable service mirrors the very qualities of warmth, professionalism, and thoughtfulness that they exude.

Watching Chef Zor evolve from his time at Restaurant Andre to taking the reins at his own establishment has been truly inspiring. Thank you for sharing your unparalleled culinary artistry with us.

We wish Restaurant Born all the very best and continued (well-earned!) success!",2023-10-24T02:40:41.637Z,1,Kathryn Rungrueng,3.0,False,,,4 months ago,,,,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ1bXN1aFhREAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_Y06ENU8h2pFOf7JK3XCXxkw8e5VVW2Nbd2En=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlwXg-tl0PZCAWa5PMyiqfmo63eA6EvBLoNEkR=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTXig0FsVdfe-hA0fNssExP2xSaJ5yDn9Wr9KM=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEryNCUXnzNaNRqscp0DIGl1gC0MhuATI-U47c=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZjUCRo8VTOZAWS8LAmT96NTBWAIi3BCh6TEZ7=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0GbYte3Ybxje2B7MCWeOj4a2R_cmfdpR4_PiJ=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsN7pyu3mQohwZecfzkumOZE5QCp9A84XfMJ70=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjyWaQde1oVHPSk_Xhc6IMdrjIBUlsOAvikaH5=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2FOP95ak_3U5xMNwwCkxlSt00PeSysFx8qyUS=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeiGqP7KAnF2CGLQH6HnZO-GRxjDYccxnICSga=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyq6qK7MaOysS8nG-3wRawXRUF7ak-WBkiO3OS=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLYKQA6N9ioiJNKsoSUSysuq1gUQxtO-MCJWCE=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_Gw4WshHSELH6DvUZqZwOPzk8tHHp-qGrdCXs=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAf6EDk-sXR3pJmtUoHVOthumo3nAAtECk4-gc=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeGWbGCRw1H-FIDEUlvIIpBRC7EC1KOfaQzSLp=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOD25W1OFyRiIm5Jy0STOetM3N0KjEUIf5rTgLp=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ1bXN1aFhREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x46b485adf1c81ac8!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID5msuhXQ%7CCgwIqd3cqQYQoN3wrwI%7C?hl=en,118016885093919445817,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX3IVB11xQVTRlSR3qkNrcyuM97TNsD9pF205unS1DzpVM=s120-c-rp-mo-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118016885093919445817?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,153

9028,Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata Restaurant in Singapore,4,"4 stars for the food not for the SERVICE! Pricing wise it‚Äôs acceptable and food is great but service wise they need to reorganise their worker and work flow.
Firstly, waiting time for food is so long not saying it‚Äôs a weekend or weekday other tables that are later than us got their food first and when we went to double check on our food their worker replied ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a queue so must wait‚Äù okay fine we wait so 10-15 mins later the food is not here yet so went to check again and told them our table have yet to have any items on the table they seems to be suspicious about us not telling the truth so we have to went back and forth many times just to check on our food order.
Secondly, I saw they put some food items onto their metal trolley which belongs to our table okay so we assume they were preparing our food but they didn‚Äôt! They left the food there and serve other tables food first while leaving those sides on the metal trolley!
Thirdly, after such a long long long time we finally get our food and guess what the person came to ask us to pay for our food. Wow we wait for our food for that long and you want us to pay our bill plus on a side note they miss out some of the items that were on the list.
Fourthly, there will be a lady incharge of billing and she will bring it to the cashier. So apparently this happen we told the lady that some items were missing and pass her a $50 together with the bill and she said she will come back with the change but ended up the lady came back claiming that we did not pass her the $50 but we did! Then next, one of her co-worker wearing a sarong top came and said ‚Äúyou guys said you pay the money but where‚Äôs the money‚Äù umm hello lady how the heck will i know where the money went we definitely did gave your co-worker the money for our meal!!! She claimed that there is 4 person working so which is the lady that we pass the money to? Umm i only see like 1 lady working throughout the entire shift tell me where is the other 3?
Lastly, the lady who took the $50 drank alcohol with her friends. Wow mind-blown man clap for this place‚Äôs mookata can work and drink at the same time.
Okay folks that‚Äôs it for the review of this place go ahead and try and see what experience you will get

It was surprisingly the crew that made the whole experience for me. They were friendly, attentive, could even get in on our jokes for a bit. Its a hot Sunday afternoon by the sea, you couldn‚Äôt ask for better vibes than this.

Food wise - Everything was fresh, delicious and beautifully presented. Nothing to fuss about! We were a group of 5 and had more food than what i‚Äôve attached in photos. They were so good i barely have time for proper photos before we dug in.

237,Rasa Istimewa Waterfront Restaurant,3,"The restaurant offers scenic views, situated as it is in a park by the sea.

During my visit,¬† the restaurant was crowded,¬† though i must say they have a pretty decent system in place to usher in diners.

Surprisingly the queue moved fast and before long we were ushered to a seat by the window.

Order taking was quick and food was served in double quick time.

The food was only OK in my opinion although I must admit that the Vegetables in garlic sauce were good to eat and cooked well too.

I must certainly give credit to the staff and service crew who were quick and willing to serve.

Overall it was a Fast into the Restaurant and Fast out of the restaurant as well.¬† Pricing seemed really reasonable.
