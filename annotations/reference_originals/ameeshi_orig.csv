7678,Iro Iro Japanese Restaurant,5,"We were so excited to eat so the photos are taken when we were halfway in. We chanced upon this place after work nearby - We ordered 2 Tempura udon (which includes fried tempura ebi, salmon, pumpkin and some enoki mushroom), dragon boat maki and a yuzu sake. The udon was amazing, soup tasted really light but flavourful with the hint of the mushroom. Noodles were cooked to a good texture and the tempura was not too oily at all! It was really comforting on a cold rainy night. My partner seldom finishes soup in soup dishes but he DEMOLISHED the whole udon.

The dragon boat maki was amazing as well, the ebi was cooked so nicely (not too oily, flour was not too much) and the salmon on it was a great addition. Very well blended taste and honestly i‚Äôm still thinking about it üòãü§§

We initially wanted to order  highball to try, but the lady boss (I assume) recommended us a yuzu sake that she had just brought in. It turned out really good and went so well with the food we ordered! She got another glass of sake (which she additionally shared with us it‚Äôs of a higher tier that is also yuzu but sweeter) That one was ü§©ü§©ü§©‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I wanted to find out what brand/type was it but she was busy. (She offered as goodwill too cause another waiter accidentally spilled my glass while he was cleaning up, hope he didn‚Äôt get scolded too much for it!!! Hahaha)

We were also then served barley tea FOC - she mentioned it was refreshing after drinking alcohol and she was right. Commendable that she is very familiar with providing her customers the best experience there. Would recommend and definitely will come back again!! It‚Äôs just 3 mins walk from lorong chuan MRT exit B. Super convenient. I have also noticed there‚Äôs a lot of regular customers coming in. Not sure about the sashimi and chawamushi, but I will definitely try it again when i‚Äôm back. ü§©",2023-11-25T02:55:12.562Z,1,Lee Joleen,39.0,False,2023-12-10T15:15:19.003Z,,3 months ago,,Dinner,Plenty of parking,$30‚Äì40,Dine in,5.0,5.0,5.0,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsM2RmeWlnRRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOiD_WFp4Cny8ag4FehicxpYtgXU938fwkumuFo=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZ6mA_xTDmbph0cyqZ0sqROAIKLJgeb1OMWVR5=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2ZMkpI8VQDD0TmnyvgJmzSsPEOUlpiNrIMvBV=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcfCWn3lcP5WJ4YVfDhdNN-6x3eZbJHagqM8O8=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsM2RmeWlnRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x320e6897bc14220f!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICl3dfyigE%7CCgwIkMSFqwYQ4JqKjAI%7C?hl=en,117934328219292461664,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXItWf71jdchCG-WtfyKpl92nsy8dJf-DJCO0BFxzHDtRI=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117934328219292461664?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,338

5574,Pixy Restaurant & Bar,2,"Had a good dining experience about two to three years ago during the Covid period. Came back to Pixy for the second time for dinner.

We ordered three dishes - bouillabaisse, grilled iberico pork collar and grilled squid, squid ink risotto. In general, the taste of the dishes is decent but we had some issues with the freshness and texture of the ingredients.

The bouillabaisse consist of two pieces of cuttlefish tentacles, one scallop, two prawns, three pieces of mackerel and some clams. Some of the ingredients wasn‚Äôt fresh and we highlighted it to the chef. He claimed that the prawns were frozen. The taste was definitely not sweet (menu indicated that it‚Äôs sweet prawn) and was mushy. The clams tasted bland, overcooked and soft. This dish is a chef‚Äôs recommendation but I definitely wouldn‚Äôt recommend it.

The taste of the grilled iberico pork collar was nice but it was at least 50% fat. Have tasted many iberico pork collar before but never this fat. The accompanying sides were decent.

The grilled squid was nicely done. However the risotto‚Äôs in the grilled squid was like a paste.

Overall the ambiance and service was nice but all the three dishes were underwhelming. It‚Äôs also unusual that a restaurant of that size has only one chef and one server on a Saturday evening.",2024-01-07T05:36:13.209Z,0,Kenny Lau,17.0,True,,,2 months ago,,Dinner,,$40‚Äì50,Dine in,5.0,2.0,5.0,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQxcm9pZlFREAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_nbupfkO_R2deyoTtN7b-tM3YoflbgfRlTYS6=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFiTixpd5EMbXmqxjVW0y9z1FlcvVnFbLOd7-Y=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIaISk6_IKsbSlE7zi7_dubK3fZygY0vOCKaOh=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnBDwgpJekeacwKsNkdw1aXJyCCsVe6sb7C6Xl=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkkKYn86BvIrIYW77oq4rk2O9qDdHrsfzpQ7IY=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQuitrG-yYFOvDoxzKRUBM5MjAfvlJIviu7xsZ=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQxcm9pZlFREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xf227f44f0e381968!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID1roifQQ%7CCgsIzfDorAYQuKjyYw%7C?hl=en,108251596692692513324,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW4lAit49AW8C2GkSRsfp2spazQ9taVYrvyiLaorJve1LE=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108251596692692513324?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,221

Spinach soup is a total disappointment. It taste like salt water instead of the broth soup.  Spinach is old and hard to chew. Will not recommend the soup at all.

2669,Black Society ÈªëÁ§æ‰ºö,4,"Tried this place for the first time after reading some of the online reviews and checking out menu. As you can read from the multiple reviews here on Google, the food is good with a wide variety of items available. Unfortunately, they really struggle with the service element. In wanting to be specific, the general service was ok for me. Just 2 things really left a sour taste in my mouth after the delicious meal:

1. Communication: when ordering drinks, I had asked my server if plain water was chargeable. What I understood from him was that as long as the table purchased some form of drinks, e.g. tea, water would be complimentary. We thus believed this to be so until the bill came and the cashier said that I was misled and didn‚Äôt have the courtesy to waive the 3 cups of plain water we ordered.

2. Pushiness in ordering: as it was my first visit and not knowing the portioning of food in terms of small, medium and large dishes, I had to rely on the order-taker to guide me in terms of what was enough for our table. Unfortunately, even when I thought enough was ordered, she still tried to nudge me to order more and dessert as well. I drew the line before dessert and true enough when the food started coming, it was overwhelming. When we tried to cancel items that had not arrived, we were not allowed to. By the end of the meal, we had to takeaway 3 almost-untouched dishes to prevent wastage of food.

For first timers, do double or triple check if unsure about what is chargeable, and go with your gut instinct rather than just trusting the order-taker to order more than sufficient.",2023-11-13T10:32:43.429Z,3,Kevin Ang,1182.0,False,2023-11-17T01:22:08.695Z,,3 months ago,,Dinner,,$50‚Äì60,Dine in,4.0,5.0,3.0,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNseU5TNTFRRRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJBTN9Gs2VWF-FHPMr3X-4tafDt5DNH8QH2JCM=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPdeml22GtDfY81ZZscTDv6QUhapwKDafg0WURE=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4Ek00SymkLV6X32QUNlzGLFjQd3jbEiKc4LwF=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObqHbDTD5j2cILKE0S5JZnBbHaC2OhRcgi7r3O=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJ7YtNvcUpgiIvHaVvVIElD6qHyXgHngjZ_hXg=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3L-nWsSlCKlEhprCVEUPvKhGEqt8N075Y-V9D=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwnmpTEU4l8rD6vZ5ViZ62VS61s1LHgokw76dN=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKh-Ew-fp4y03Cr1k8HckKr8w0eIGv8SvfHhQ3=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOI-RPpiQZ56v0c7WnH0_PAmQXfA_ii_VFmABl0=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaWth0VJVV1i9RtoA0bpy4cIIG5g6jqE95vpVv=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOn-nNaL_PbWDJ2Q38y845BpodcJoz6emFQj4-h=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNt1m_r6UvHi1wS9UnOBAWrtCBjR6jIKHKJDyM=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9roE9Py4e4vlAUOTeljc7-pyvrMddxxqwikXC=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6l6llDHLCfQAJ8Oslz-hhjc0TgNhgdibCbR-D=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNseU5TNTFRRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xa966633b8edd7030!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIClyNS51QE%7CCgwIy_bHqgYQuJXhzAE%7C?hl=en,111247294128726535324,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUX0ZXuhYrTr87Mp20qWHDl6PCpr88GgZcTGaY0Mv1NheE=s120-c-rp-mo-ba7-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111247294128726535324?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,293

5633,Miyabi Japanese Restaurant,3,"Personally have never been a big fan of Raffles Town Club, especially with the ethical sagas that they have been put through in the past. Irregardless, find them very stuffy vs the newer Private Members Clubs in Singapore. Likewise, Miyabi, being the mainstay Japanese restaurant of Raffles Town Club, has this air of gloominess, age, and staleness the moment you walk in.

Coupled with the fact that only members can access the restaurant, there's automatically a discrimination towards a certain cluster of target audience.

It's probably good for family gatherings on the weekends, as you have private access to a teppanyaki space for yourselves. Prices are reasonable too, for the amount of food they serve as part of their teppanyaki sets. Get the lobster and beef set menu, and you should be sorted for the evening.

Food quality is good but not great. All else accounted for, I'm sure there are better Japanese restaurants around Singapore. This space reminds me of it being run like a passion project, not like a competitive f&b business in Singapore.

If you're looking for a space to chat and talk as a family dinner, this may not be for you, as you'll be sitting quite far away from each other, surrounding the teppanyaki hotplate.

9245,The Sapling Restaurant,4,"First time here. Made a Saturday lunch reservation which was confirmed via email by the Asst Mgr. Imagine my surprise when we arrived and was told that they do not have our reservation. Luckily, the place was empty except for us and another party.

We had menu 2. Food was tasty and comparable to similar items served in more atas cafes but at a discounted price. For soup, we were served with a chipped porcelain spoon. Please have the server check all cutlery before serving.

For the bakery located outside, it is advisable to have the payment and packing at the same location. The baked goods that I bought did not tally with the ones I received. They packed the baked goods behind the counter, bring it to the restaurant cashier for check-out. Customer will then procced to pay. There should be a verification step with customer to show them what was purchased.

Overall, I would return to try the dinner menu. Best of all, there's free parking on site.

7974,Hoy Yong Seafood Restaurant,1,"Ordered takeaway on a Sunday evening and waited one full hour despite placing our order at 625pm. The lady did warn us that the waiting time is 60mins before I placed our order so I guess that was somewhat fair.

However, none of the dishes was worth the hour‚Äôs wait. Food was very mediocre and super overpriced. The ten boxes in the photo was $184.

We had ordered Medium sized French Bean with Shrimp ($28!!!) and Medium Claypot tofu ($20+). There were barely any tofu and it was mostly gravy. The medium Prawn Paste Chicken was also $20+ for 9 pieces and the store didn‚Äôt have boxes with holes that allowed the hot steam from fried food to escape, so our wings were soggy and sad. The duck rolls which were supposedly a speciality at the shop was also odd tasting and didn‚Äôt really stand out for us.

Carbs wise, we got the medium egg Hor fun and medium crispy noodles. I don‚Äôt think there was much wokhey in the noodle dishes and it was pretty forgettable.

I would not recommend this place to anybody.

3065,Burger & Lobster Jewel Changi Airport,4,"Nice experience.

We had a long layover at the airport and treated ourselves to dinner to celebrate the end of our travelling journey.

Staff were super friendly and helpful. The view of the waterfall area was nice to view from where we were seated.

We got 2 rounds of cocktails and the sharing. Which we would recommend for those who are hungry! Worked out well for us. A whole lobster, a roll of your choice, burger of your choice and two sides of your choice.

Lobster was grilled and was nice but slightly lacking in that fresher flavour that I‚Äôve had other places.
They were also out of the chicken burger which we would‚Äôve liked to try.
Other patrons were a little bit rude, two people in T-shirts and younger seemed to annoy them. But we didn‚Äôt care that much. And the staff made us feel very welcome. Maybe seating a little further apart for the bar stools

Overall a nice experience for the food and drinks if you‚Äôre looking at spending some time in the airport area.",2023-05-10T13:07:46.905Z,0,Bethan Hannah,245.0,True,,,9 months ago,,Dinner,,$40‚Äì50,Dine in,,,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4LUt2TDJBRRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPdZNpv3ZzMFzqs1IfZIFu24mzvu4kOkRNZjLGf=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO32LL93soS1gAYLPu0zlv6d80lKgs7wy00VtDK=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORPAD9yvhjw47IzWBru4OBgZCJ90ZsglTj1n3j=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkfm4CmhS-frC_Bh3h30Ke0tQHZYK5sUHEz87s=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcHygo2uNKw2_0dpcJL-dXpsV-c0hg6MnkQbPZ=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvYhjstGA70aHPLahr2wr_84hpbBKz_fO3daiX=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPg8vk8sSeKWE2oDaYLJ-8Ne3SAYQbrSG9VKfdj=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4LUt2TDJBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xdabd35e8ea973e14!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICx-KvL2AE%7CCgwIoq7uogYQqIfnrwM%7C?hl=en,115838181974631302812,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV1noBVFak4lYeYSNUFOco03ChwFA-fku_LDYp_Eiwz0Jo=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115838181974631302812?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,178

We had a home lunch party for about 11 adults (7 non veg, 4 vegetarians) Ordered for a delivery through Tandoori Corner‚Äôs website. $347 incl delivery

The food arrived on time, still warm and well packed (briyanis were in plastic bentos and ala cartes were in individual plastic containers, naan wrapped in foil)

We took some poor pictures so can only post our delivery receipt to show our satisfaction. Everyone enjoyed the hearty and tasty meal and our party was a success! Thank you Surender and Tandoori Corner!!!!

Prev post Dec 2022
Been enjoying Tandoori Corner for years‚Ä¶ since I was an omnivore and have continued as a vegetarian. A long overdue review!

The menu is extensive, there is something for everyone.  Typically we come for dinner to enjoy the cool alfresco seating. We also used to cater with Tandoori Corner for our home parties and office functions (before covid) and everyone is happy.

But yesterday the lunch atmosphere was great too. We ordered the set lunches, generous portions for $10-12 each, add a drink for $1.

The tofu egg wasn't that nice.

The chawamushi was good but it had a layer of sauce that was sweet and sour which wasn't pleasant.

The crab sauce dumplings had too thick of a skin, and the fillings were not springy enough.

2582,March√© M√∂venpick VivoCity,4,"A non halal eatery. Have dined at marche for a good few times. All the while, they are well knowned for their rosti. Still one of the best after so many years. Crispy on the outside and soft inside. Pair well with the sour cream. Do expect to queue and wait for your turn and dish to be ready. Once you are at ordering counter..service is relatively fast. Menu clearly states what is available and TODAY'S SPECIAL. So, if you want to be served fast; think about what you want to order while in line before reaching ordering counter.

Dishes are generally made for 1 person portion. So maybe sharing is possible if you are in a group to taste relatively different food available.

Some food station practice ordering and wait for your food to be ready before collection using a buzzer such as pizza counter and pasta counter.

Dessert wise...only still can stomach in ice cream. LOVED IT!!!!!!!. very very nice, not too creamy.

3890,Le Jardin Restaurant,2,"Expensive food and small portion for brunch.
Drinks were pretty and tasted ok. Deco inside the cafe was beautiful.

We went with a dog and it rained really heavily.  When it was starting to rain, we asked the waitress for another place to dine, we were told there was no place we can finish our drinks inside the restaurant with a dog with us.
We tried to finish our drinks at the outdoor seats but the rain got heavy very fast.

We were only led to the patio by another waitress which is sheltered and at the side of the restaurant when my partner and I stand by the door of the restaurant due to the very heavy rain because the outdoor umbrella cannot shelter 4 people from the rain. We were drenched and standing there looking at the nice deco in the restaurant like the girl in the story of ""Little Match Girl"". Just nice that day was Christmas day.. So much feels.

7720,Jiang Ëî£ÂÖàÁîü Cantonese Asian Tapas,1,"$10.80 - XO carrot cake
$12.80 - octopus karaage
$11.80 - roast pork
$12.80 - braised pork belly with preserved vegetable
$15.80 - kailan 2 ways
$2 - plain rice
$3.50 - Thai iced tea
$2.50 - oolong tea

Our total bill for this place came up to $83.38, even after a card discount that took the signature carrot cake off the bill.

This place is incredibly overpriced. The place was empty when we went and the server seems nice enough, but the food ranged from average to bad.

The carrot cake was probably the best, but was average at best, like what you would get at dimsum places... Look at the size... That's 10.80++!

Octopus karaage was not crunchy and the portion was super small, while the sauce was like mayo, worse than sweechoon's kind of trashy sauce.

The kailan was just fried with floss on top... $15.80++! Are you kidding me?

The braised pork belly had so little pork that my friend had a piece each and I only had preserved vegetable. Just look at the pork in the picture... You can barely find any. $12.80 for preserved vegetable.

The winner is the ""Thai iced tea"" as it was described in the menu. It was clearly bottled tea.

It was not crowded at all which at first was slightly worrying to me, but after we tried the first dish that we ordered, the rest just kept getting better than the dish before! We had Cavatelli pasta with generous serving of squid, delicious carbonara cooked on a slab of cheese at the table, roasted octopus, and a shoulder of lamb that went excellently with toasted sourdough. The service was also fantastic, and Edward was very friendly and accommodating to our requests. It was a very satisfying and perfect slow lunch on a lazy Sunday afternoon.

While eating I noticed a pattern that is quite similar to Citrus by the pool and realized they both are the same company!
I loved the waffles and the portion of the ice cream was huge! I think the waiter gave me a different flavor instead of what I requested which I didn't even notice till my wife pointed it out! Guess I was too busy enjoying the waffle.
Their Cajun lamb chops need a slight improvement as it was a bit chewy but the flavour was good and the mashed potatoes were tasty!

2061,Azur,2,"The restaurant just reopened a week ago and it‚Äôs our first time at the buffet. The place was quite quiet, buffet spread is limited but have ample seats. The bbq pork ribs was the best dish among all. The Malaysia lok lok section have quite a lot of selection but they didn‚Äôt have a good deep fryer where the food wasn‚Äôt fried enough. So some came out uncooked and very oily inside. Hot coffee and tea is included in the buffet. Dessert was not good‚Ä¶ the worst would be the kueh pie tee. The look of it won‚Äôt make you wana try as the stew vege was so dry and burnt. The cups have a bad oil taste too.

2570,Tambi Restaurant,4,"Had a great meal at Tambi. Arrived at the restaurant on the dot and was showed to our seats. Looks pretty intimate dining at counter seats could see the chefs at work. A bit small but I believe there are bigger tables upstairs for bigger groups.
Asked the staff for recommendations and was given a few to decide. In the end since we were here we decided to order everything that was recommended.
Began with the starters, the Yellowtail Ssam which tasted interesting cooked Indian style and was complemented with the charred pineapple. Loved the pineapple which brought sweetness to the dish. The beef tartare was my most favourite in the starters which I believe should be ordered. If not the Oxtail bone marrow Murtabak should also be on the order list because it tasted so flavorful and richness of the oxtail.
Was given 2 recommendations for mains but we initially ordered one and then finally decided to get the other. First was the prawn  Maggie goreng, filled with wokhey you can see it as the chef was cooking and very fresh and giant prawn. Then we ordered and the 2nd main came which was the Australian wagyu bulgogi roti which I would say this would probably be the star of the night. So good and all the ingredients complemented each other so well the beef could just melt in the mouth.

Sashimi was fresh, and almost all cuts of meat tasted rich and creamy. The swordfish was the standout fish.

The Natsu bento set came with a variety of side dishes. Tha beef yakiniku was well seasoned and well cooked, and the garlic fried rice was fragrant and not too salty.

The beef yuzu sauteed is an interesting dish to try, being served with a yuzu sorbet at the side. The beef was nicely cooked, and eaten with the yuzu sorbet creates an interesting flavour and sensation, fusing sweet, sour, and savoury, and balancing warm and cold.

2500,NAEUM Restaurant,4,"Thank you for making my first omakase experience at your restaurant so special! It was a belated birthday celebration with my best friend, and the entire afternoon was truly memorable.

The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. When I realized I couldn't eat the beef in the ""SO BBQ"" dish (the description only mentioned hanging tenderloin), they quickly offered a delicious fish alternative without any hesitation. I truly appreciate their understanding and willingness to ensure I had a wonderful dining experience. Perhaps adding small icons to the menu indicating the type of meat in each dish would be helpful for future diners, especially those with allergies or preferences. For non-Korean speakers, adding translations or clearer description could improve understanding.

The food was fantastic overall, with a variety of creative and flavourful dishes. The sauces were flavorful, but perhaps a touch too strong for some of the dishes, slightly masking the delicate taste of the main ingredient. I also absolutely loved their kombucha and hope they consider selling it in batches in the future!

2316,Kailash Parbat Restaurant,2,"This feedback is especially only for Kailash Parbat Changi and I am a regular customer at KP Little India. I visited around 8.15 PM along with my friends family for Dinner for my daughter's birthday and we were total 13 pax. First of all, as usual food was amazing except MINI NAAN BOMB(it was in expired state which was shocking and unexpected for us but we just thought like it can happen sometime).. Now reason for giving 1 star for service, the service was extremely slow and no one was bothered to check back, we were keep calling them for the orders but it was very careless response always.. When we were placing one final order around 9.10 PM, person taking order immediately said as ""no more roti's(breads)"" is possible as we are closing now. Why I am surprised is because she didn't even listen as what I am about to order so it was very bad experience and I believe Kailash Parbat at Changi is good only for Buffets and not for Ala Carte as staff are very lazy and bit rude.. One last thing is our bill was 250+ so we were been informed that we can go for some complimentary or discount of 5% on bill but we were done with our food so we opted for discount which was not applied during payment and when I called & checked back with restaurant, response is that its customer's responsibility to inform during payment at counter as we cannot check with each customer during payment, its funny again as response was bit hard to listen. So guys plan accordingly at this outlet specifically  when planning for Ala Carte so that you don't get face disappointment.",2024-02-06T09:21:26.046Z,0,Nitesh Pareek,3.0,False,,,a month ago,,Dinner,,$30‚Äì40,Dine in,3.0,4.0,1.0,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWLTlHY1RBEAE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWLTlHY1RBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xf0aa01cf18d08bd6!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDV-9GcTA%7CCgsIlvSHrgYQ6OebFg%7C?hl=en,106601549824261476634,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLmY5r8j3_1gFvRkXnO1qUSYU0hDM7TnxUFd8KkyOJ3=s120-c-rp-mo-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106601549824261476634?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,287

7205,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,4,"Went for the buffet on a weekday evening.

This is our 3rd time eating. And each time the food standard has changed and dropped. Now for 45++ for dinner, it is quite a steep price. But u do get a good variety of food. Some hits some misses.

The abacus used to be awesome, but the last 2 visits were disappointing. The roast and bbq pork was good, standards maintained. Drunken prawns  good too. Chilli crab, lacked flavour but the crab quality was solid n meaty. Buddha jump over the wall was decent, with an abalone, black chicken, mushroom some cordecyp flowers and a tiny dried scallop. The kailan was quite salty. Spinach 3 egg was average. Orh nee dessert good altho i didn't fancy the coconut cream. Mango sago normal.

Staff was friendly and thoughtful. But then again we were the ONLY table that evening.

The buffet is a good option to try various options. Portions are standard zichar sizes and not small plates so if u go eat in a small group, you may not be able to try many dishes cos you'll be full early on.",2022-10-13T15:45:36.979Z,0,Vanessa Tay,63.0,False,,,a year ago,,Dinner,,,Dine in,4.0,3.0,4.0,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlcVp5dXF3RRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0u6W0suBbQfEHFW8k6CHLnGkGwrtwwA7sTxrz=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO768WGZGOjnkyKy4vq_4nUPgSQxZFX3WwPTsZ6=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlcVp5dXF3RRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x41afa224dc74e791!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDeqZyuqwE%7CCgwIoOWgmgYQwPP-0gM%7C?hl=en,103988477386126257243,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXjorIRyR_EDqVfcfxRC7PaNPHY9Fc2ZjhrUiLaLYP-IeM=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103988477386126257243?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,189

1514,eM By The Marina,2,"Mixed Experience (Visit Date 26 Jun 22)

It was great that:
1.Not crowded when we went at 6pm and got a cosy corner seat
2. Friendly servers
3. Casual environment
4. The food came fast
5. Quesadilla, Samosa, Aglio Olio were good

Disappointing:
1. Ordered sweet potato fries.  Got us  regular fries. They took it back. A gentleman came back to say they didn't have sweet potato. So we asked to give us regular ones. Then someone got us some soggy ones. The same ones they made by mistake for us earlier?
2. The lady seemed to get things a little mixed up. Messed up the fries and then just forgot we had ordered quesadillas.
3. Prices (of drinks that we got) at par or more than FOC Sentosa or Coastes.
