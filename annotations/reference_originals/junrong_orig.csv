10445,Long Beach UDMC,5,"I had a fantastic experience at this restaurant! The food was absolutely superb, and the service was top-notch. During my visit for lunch, I had the pleasure of trying both the chili and pepper crab dishes. The crab meat was incredibly fresh, and the dark pepper sauce was a standout‚Äîit paired perfectly with the crab. To end on a sweet note, I indulged in the mango coconut dessert, which was not only beautifully presented but also impressively layered.

Experience not very good. I came here during lunch hour with colleagues. Food tasted very plain, shrimp not fresh, steam fish over cooked, soup over-powered by Chinese cooking wine taste. Most important of all - serving speed is extremely slow (we are just one of the 3 tables), and both our table and the table next to us are constantly asking them to speed up. We spent most of the time just waiting. Absolutely not suitable for business lunch.
What I like:
- plenty of parking lots
- air conditioned
What can be improved:
- food taste need to be greatly improved
- serving frustratingly slow",2018-10-08T05:37:26.544Z,5,Steven Li,73.0,True,,,5 years ago,,,,,,,,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBelktLXNBRRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfUQ4y8qlzKFM8iucDNTB5aO0ptZUSQCDGhanh=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMe_FNxBEU1GLnLrm-5GjGz9T_oqrPapLl085Jr=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbqhowJJWtKR_q34khVybenisaNEZV5W_CDlgm=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzm2rwHm_Fq1KXvQhKdE1jyJOjDVtV7KjH9k_s=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAZG4X4L5H_NZcvcWnhPLuM42UvakMwnyRPGad=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPU3u8q7kw6xAnU27YbiB8n2fKUlgd-5EtQt-1h=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLo5y2eMnMV_FyLh0ZTSPa34KQlTuerhcvh1YM=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPN0J3poCFij-FldqUkZyYbYSLdteoHHJ5rbYgH=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZ_rW4yly1YXmQdD6MOMJ52xjV0JzBn27S1_Xg=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKc5uEHXWDou1fwQgpPHU-u1YZn00ACMOKYevd=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNl9Lo_DgVxYjcutL6RdwHe0pgtxOoPRlOtp8R0=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBelktLXNBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x8d2ccef01affd948!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICAzY--sAE%7CCgwIltrr3QUQmI3bgwI%7C?hl=en,100923375930929911174,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVWuzQTXUqCIL3v-O8p8NDbe4GkvOWu93sB275tPii3Kw4=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100923375930929911174?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,110

10181,Path Restaurant,4,"I rarely have a ""fancy"" lunch but on a friends recommendation (she also hasn't been), we decided to give it a try. Great first impressions upon entering the restaurant- very agreeable interior design and furnishings and a very warm welcome was extended. The menu was indeed interesting with 2, 3 and course options priced very reasonably at $45, $55 and $65. The selection was not extensive but very well curated with sufficient choices to whet one's appetite. There are surcharges for more premium selections but we found them very worthwhile and value for money. 4 of us ordered various combinations and every dish from starters to desserts were impressive from plating presentation to taste. In short  a great restaurant with a well curated menu, very well executed dishes (sauces for all mains and starters were uniquely different), great elegant ambience and certainly value for money. I would return to dine here for sure. The Chef definitely knows what he is doing and the service crew was great ..attentive, responsive and knowledgeable.  We need more restaurants of this calibre and price point.

5005,‰∏ÄÂìÅÂ±Ö‰∏≠È§êÈ¶Ü Yi Pin Ju Chinese Restaurant,1,"Visited this restaurant a month back on a Sunday evening with a party of 4. I ordered 3 dishes  - steamed pork belly (Ê¢ÖËèúÊâ£ËÇâ), steamed sea bass, a vegetable plus soup . The vegetable and soup were great but when it came to the steamed pork belly, we were shocked to find out that the inside of the dish was frozen! Which means the dish wasn't prepared to order. They must have cooked it on another occasion, kept in the freezer, and steamed it again before serving. When we informed the server, she hurriedly told the lady boss who replied it's ok - we can steam it again?!? When the sea bass was served, we also noted that almost a third of the flesh on one side of the fish was missing. As I had a guest with me, I didn't want to kick up a fuss. There were obviously a lot of other repeat customers in the restaurant as they know the lady boss personally.

Chicken paella - tasted better than it looks. Looks a little overdone and burnt. The staff squeezed the lemon for us with his bare hands, who knows if he had washed his hands before. And then he stirred the paella for us so vigorously some ingredients flew out onto the table.

Seafood tapas - portion was generous.

Omellete tapas - yummy.

Lastly, very rude manager who came over and told us to repeat our order of drinks (even when we said we JUST ordered from another service staff) -  he said ""oh he tends to forget so just tell me what you ordered"".

5628,"NAYANA Kpop Cafe & Restaurant@Poiz, Central Singapore, nice late supper Korean food, indoor pet friendly, vegetarian options",4,"Looking for a place to hangout and not so crowded. Randomly chanced upon this on google map and there i went.
Serves a great variety of korean food, including sliced noodle, korean dumpling soup, chilli hotplate chicken with cheese.
An authentic rare find for a kpop style cafe filled with female kpop singer music.

I presume i can visit a few more times just to try all the good food.
The korean dumpling soup is delicious, with smooth and tasty dumplings, filled with meat and rice vermicelli.
The hotplate chilli chicken is lacking compared to chuncheon dakgalbi, but still tender and filling for us.
The 3x chilli tofu stew is my friend's personal favorite, but its too spicy for me. Definitely packed a punch.

The bad thing about this place is that the air-conditioning is bad, and we are sweating profusely with hot and spicy food.

9232,The Sapling Restaurant,5,"Nice cosy restaurant that is suitable for parties too. Location is opposite the Bukit Batok Swimming complex. Food is good, portions are decent. Do make reservations before coming down. It's run by students from Shatec. We had a birthday cake and they took the effort to put the candles and the birthday signs for us. There was a robot server that also helped to sing the happy birthday song. We had the braised beef cheek, the pan seared salmon, the striploin steak, and it also has 2 free kids meal for every 2 paying adults who order from the set meals. It's basically a 3 course dinner. They have bread and soup of the day. I especially liked the sorbet which was very refreshing! I thought its very well worth it for the price point and a good way to support our local culinary institute students to gain more experience in their line of work.

5811,Cheese Story Mookata Buffet,3,"As we walked around the building thinking about what to eat after learning that our initial plan of having Mookata buffet was smashed due to that the shop was closed for a short period of time, we decided on an alternative Mookata Buffet at Cheese Story.

Before the pandemic, diners can help themselves with the free flow of food items from the designated collection point. Diners have to fill up the form on their preferred order.

The server set up the Mookata stove with few big pieces of pork lard in the middle of the pot surrounded by a pool of stock and a small tray of cheese by the side.

Let's wait for the pot to get hot and the lard to be melted so as to oil the pot.

Besides having meat, we do order some vegetables, quail eggs and vermicelli items.

Here are some more of our orders with cheese tofu, fish cake, hotdog, dumplings, luncheon meat etc.

Do not worry about the shells if you are ordering the crayfish as the server on duty will help us to deshell.

One of the consolations is that the service includes deshell of the crayfish which we find quite comfortable. The staff on duty will do it on the spot in front of us with a pair of gloves.

Other than that, the free flow of oysters. The oysters are plump and they are generous with the servings.

Other than Oysters, abalone, prawns, and crayfish. We have ordered bamboo clams, scallops, Lala, sotong (Squid) and deshelled prawns that were marinated with garlic chilli.

Here's our second round of meat, They are marinated with black pepper and garlic.

Let's dig in! The chilli they provided is not too bad but I prefer to dip most of my food into the cheese tray.

The shredded cheese was left at the side tray of the Mookata pot to melt with Nachos cheese. For the price of $29.90 Nett for Buffet style of Mookata, I find it worthwhile with the unlimited flow of seafood. Drinks are unlimited too and the server will come with a trolley of drinks and assist to top up our cups.

For the quantity and money, I will say one can enjoy having Mookata at a budgeted price. If you don't mind spending more on quality style Mookata, there are better ones within Golden Mile Complex.",2021-05-25T05:54:25.653Z,2,umake mehungry,282.0,False,,,2 years ago,,,,,,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxeU9DTEF3EAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdmVpTPJOFKth09kNg3ob9vEEU4gxiImSvbOwg=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7uK31awVjceoCsmUROtTZ1gYgphhCTJT9o1b7=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMp-Tx0vVNqFaHQrybLiG-gyZRBBj7lLFOXGjnd=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQHRwANKzBnzyrRE9uxXh9h2tnpDi1cCEQGGxM=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOi681kkPBoX-hwGOh7T2l0M8sMvM1MEoRYITq=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPL2GzAznWv6bLRNWBU7JNij26pawZxSVTOjaGg=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOs_M4oZvhr8_u7S401bDnx32qATyx59NffaG4x=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5PY73PY-iq7FmT6u56UoqbwJWweNiRFsxOTRW=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIECPrzQ6A3gz3yVv9X3rMV3AEZ9Du3IRBwfSb=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRkNlocJp2HRR80n9T3khTs-poEaWeP9S-cbul=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNaJHP699PESx5E0SWDzxU2ruAqvoIRmVE9Crj1=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHGC6f5ykOsEEzrTstRxSxe6BudYfl8hNcXFCN=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUgTnDqRu-WUk_giVBpT1IvJBPfTPjbj2h8nbI=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNo7kP6Qu3mhBthUpS1dOBgJcWcpRohMgJMd6Pk=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxeU9DTEF3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xdfd16e0cbb3d93f3!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICqyOCLAw%7CCgwIkaKyhQYQ6MLZtwI%7C?hl=en,111406931807185833571,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVFfMhvVs6JpQh2p8CY1FSDro1aJOeCnaXYELXjuUnLbg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111406931807185833571?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,397

Classic Chengdu Seabass in Sour Pickled Soup which was seasoned just nice for my taste - not overly sour with a hint of chilli.  I usually dislike seabass but this really changed my view.

Awesome Spicy Chilli Chicken (minus the Fried Dough Twist) which was aromatic with great spicy and numbing flavour.  The little bits of dried garlic in the dish was fragrant as well.

Sichuan Inspired Traditional Homemade Mapo Tofu was a little oily but it was surprisingly spicy.

Stir-fried Jack Beans with Red Chillis and Sichuan Pickles is usually a hit-or-miss dish. Most restaurants fail to remove the fibrous seams but here they have done really well. Each stalk was plump and full of flavour.

Osmanthus Fermented Wine with Rice Balls was a sweet ending to the savoury dinner.  It's good if you have a sweet tooth.

The only thing that wasn't ideal was the plain rice which was probably pre-scooped as the top layer had already dried and hardened.",2024-02-27T14:00:29.022Z,0,Pauline W,100.0,False,,,a week ago,,Dinner,,,Dine in,5.0,5.0,5.0,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkbThfVF93RRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUUJxWQyxnwomawLYIGbLE6RfAjw0Xs1D5OJVZ=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYelKtOiVhwgg58DLtvtzWz27l7UNusFzFOshd=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAoIzkS_nPCiWd3pll6aZstbEe9VM1g7Tz4C7i=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMoY9EMbNKpZcey3Q5rozjJvn9zFQujR975iUgZ=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO70dmL3ImPhCtqbEByvQvZ8xeXobGnGjAL8HsR=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkbThfVF93RRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xf3d17db878772450!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDdm8_T_wE%7CCgsI_dX3rgYQyNDmCg%7C?hl=en,110148346935144645330,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV407fmyEXHxArIMpXdVOwzYMTb2gyuIHqOgzQws3-w2Z8=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110148346935144645330?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,164

3796,Sol & Ora,5,"Sol & Ora

Located on a quiet level of The Outpost Hotel Sentosa, Sol & Ora is a Mediterranean cuisine restaurant with a Latin vibe.

What caught my attention were the Greek dishes on the menu. The only thing that came to my mind was Ouzo,  a dry anise-flavored aperitif that is widely consumed in Greece.

However, other than some of the Greek wines, I see no Ouzo. I tried my luck and asked the restaurant manager, who is a Russian-Greek, to offer me his private stash of Ouzo.

He explained that as there is only a small committee of Greeks in Singapore, not many restaurants or people will know such a spirit. Well, I'm sure glad that I asked.

Spirits aside, food and service were great. The restaurant manager was jovial and able to recommend wine pairing dishes.

The octopus dish is a must-order dish. The parma hams blended so well with the unsalted octopus and well grilled potatoes.

Forgive me if i cant praise this restaurant higher and better.

Their service is excellent, they respect every guests, serve politely and most important, they are able to present their food with confidence, which I don‚Äôt often see that in many Michelin 1-star restaurants.

Their theme is onion, every bit of this restaurant cohere with this theme and very well executed. Every dish has its own stunning way to impress diner, each has its little back story and each is presented in an surprising manner. I appreciated the bomba rice the most as it shows the bravery and innovation the chef has with the food, even it is just rice. Not sure if they call themself molecular gastronomy, but last time I had such innovative experience was in Bo innovation.

And as equally important, I think they are quite generous in using luxury ingredients, like a ping pong size caviar is just pure indulgent.

I don‚Äôt have much Michelin 2star dining experience but among other 1 star restaurants I had in the past, this one is simply the best and deserve differentiation from the rest.",2022-12-16T01:05:31.224Z,0,jason,83.0,True,,,a year ago,,Lunch,,,Dine in,,,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMHRtQzBBRRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTipLKVs85lXXYmwsB8VLH9Qr9cQfWl-ReTl-_=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjuaBSUrwwGe1EKp9xRzlezLPivfbXcEV6uDrA=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbXFQCDW8LEFP4zaMkLpRNM_Ben-uef6IbEgOY=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrC6O1qPbhkTAsvI7NvffDCPkELqWJEcXEpmx7=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXJOuufksbKQdBnvxnqhYPIw6OalDqAEE3_VcV=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMHRtQzBBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xc8722006f054d784!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDe0tmC0AE%7CCgsI24jvnAYQ4Kudaw%7C?hl=en,114846144741751671056,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocI5pGaL0DPrKcOgrr4bMzuo39dldau0OK_AnNlxYvAG=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114846144741751671056?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,194

7114,Genki Sushi Junction 8,4,"On my visit this time around, I spent around $80 for 2 pax which is quite pricey in my opinion, but we managed to sample a variety of dishes. My craving for Japanese cuisine led me back to this familiar location, as I've had decent experiences with this sushi chain in the past. This time, however, my dining experience was satisfactory but not exceptional. The food was decent, and the service was average, although one staff member appeared visibly discontent.

As usual I'd order their salmon belly sashimi which is acceptable, 3/5, and their salmon sashimi which was disappointing,1/5. Both the sashimi dishes were not fresh at all, and they were poorly sliced. The only difference was that the salmon belly sashimi came in thicker slices compared to the regular salmon sashimi.

Their Chuka Idako, seasoned baby octpopus, were a little too big for my liking. The takoyaki was also quite poorly made. They were a little overcooked on the outside, tasted dry on the inside, and they did not give it enough toppings. Their fried squid tentacles were also a little too salty in my opinion. I also ordered their scallop sushi which was quite tasteless and not worth the price. I tried their promotional dish, the snow crab leg sushi, and it was also not worth it. The crab leg was too tiny. Another promotional dish I tried was the crab chawanmushi and it was the best dish out for all.

Overall, my dining experience here so far has been alright. For the quality, I'd say this place is a little overpriced. While dining here is acceptable, don't expect top quality food or service.

Edit 24/12/23:
I ordered food delivery from here via Grabfood. I had their salmon sashimi, salmon belly sashimi and hotate sashimi. Surprisingly this time round the Sashimi was better compared to when I dined in. The quality was better, it tasted fresher and the cuts were better sliced. I also ordered some variety of sushi and all were decent. What surprised me the most was the delivery time. It was delivered 10mins faster than Grab's prediction despite me ordering slightly past lunch time.",2023-12-24T07:02:05.964Z,0,Bryan Lon,124.0,False,,,2 months ago,,Dinner,,$40‚Äì50,Dine in,4.0,4.0,3.0,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwaDRmVVRREAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTQquWkGL8j_0gZGdjLqwYBDCUQOat3BWJHYRv=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPExhRWPC0JD2_c-KvfdwwgdkyPttGQkws2d6Hh=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCe8sucI-w32jF064QuBGsn8LhENJdIi-GKmiJ=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLsB8hOYJf_IdebmCwizpC_dxqBS7msvJCW0lu=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPsQRLw8E0vnKGaUfsQcpFFQIed7phOk5Rrl3Il=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQN9TiKZ8Nvc_HwfRquP0QN2gOjugbWpZE27ya=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAowZJINHdWmkqxPAIExa8k3bndpnM-bR-vQw2=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMd_3GtAMZSZ4OoTL6qEztpOAq7MB-weJ9Ydic3=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNArI1d_r9lppEB80cUuRwdIAYbGixLLZ8fh1iL=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVwItlS3979wHvt-Mfx5Y5bm1nQLimxvnU6qYH=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeAgHUbc5yaaebsF2clm0W_bFUsSvrlhig1Mmp=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6kgLaI7JjFxTXZNkpQulnPC3Dm2r-E5mBcuhb=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuf_k_SBa8kPMyMWLDt4_Wp0WxbjxVJJeFQIOG=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfxYqtnxiLdxkDrl3o8klOpg6CtMFDpqJWodfr=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3n1jUYbm9ykDIiw41bb5gy03jQBiFiJPEvevW=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUp2Yb9B1rMDAtF90ftJ9DuAXiWDWBbg5CyMFg=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwH4frIky4ogbOBWoBCO_nfTGtakJISKZoD-6W=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEozKkFtZ7f0SFMAWsjFNg2TAxlok7P7s7Iz2f=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUIP9lAsxhsjEvwQjchlm2EjHG8sL2euHuim0e=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODmfrTP2DB34GJAw2FJH2y7bVB07QZQfcNrN4v=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwXuqg053cz1sH1zuhmcnNHIwLickCI9UYXZjw=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnhlTvlFFyFLe-z7mMDalXmviZ6JsqDXpGsW9l=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKeZDqNtsIazOL7yhi67lBoZkteel3QsXKylfc=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHYdxptwCP-mYBlf0apYK5S6DSLQeOlcdX-Xhj=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhGBhMd2sf_T_0MAvJivv2gmPeT1QCqBu4bTGN=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwaDRmVVRREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x46d6046d2966f4e0!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDph4fUTQ%7CCgwI7a6frAYQiPjgywM%7C?hl=en,101869506055887544256,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW8_LaMy35UJfcxn3gMaT-5KhsBwwizgIT1hTu9DuS05Nxh=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101869506055887544256?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,359

2069,Azur,2,"This is the first time i encounter a restaurant that refuse early guest when they are not even half filled. We had a reservation at 7pm, however we made ourselves arrive earlier because we both were excited about our date. Never did we expect that hotel of such calibre would refuse to seat their guest until 15 mins before reservation time. How inflexible.

The food is nothing fantastic. Label of food is wrong placed, some with no label. Chicken rice too oily, satay cooked on hotplate is not acceptable hotel restaurant standard. Maybe the foreigners can accept this. only 4 types of cheap seafood on ice. How pathetic. the Cha soba was over cooked and still placed out for guest. the noodles was mushy and sauce was super diluted. Did the chef even try what was placed out?

7076,Tsukada Nojo - Thomson Plaza,4,"Collagen soup is recommended. The taste is rich and essence of chicken is well-infused into the broth. Vegetables are fresh and sweet. I feel that for $19, the collagen soup can do better with at least some ingredients in it. Condiments, the leek oil is flavourful. Nanbe chicken could do better with better frying of the batter. The dish tasted a little under fried and batter was soft.

Staff used to be and could be more attentive. The broth was boiling away and they only adjusted the induction cooker upon request, twice. No one came to skim the floating fats off the soup or offer a sampling of it, which they used to do so. Also, there wasn‚Äôt any personal touch to make you feel welcome whatsoever.

5950,Osia Steak and Seafood Grill,2,"Cannot meaningfully recommend this. Below average experience. We ordered 3 Med rare ribeyes; one was burnt and sent back, the other was underdone (very rare) but we didn‚Äôt want to send back yet another steak. We ordered 2 lamb chops and sent back 1 for being burnt on the outside. Seafood platter (at 288) was poor; sauce was very one dimensional.

Service excellent and flatbread appetiser was good. Excellent service is the reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1.

This restaurant seems to cater to the patrons of rws instead of being a destination in itself. There are many better steakhouses at a similar price point in SG. The table behind us also complained about the seafood platter. That said, we were told the main chef was on leave the day we dined so perhaps our poor food was a one-off. However, at this price point, much more is expected.",2023-01-28T01:58:09.225Z,0,Joel Tan,169.0,True,2023-01-28T04:52:58.878Z,,a year ago,,,,,,,,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCMDdhTjlRRRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2rWtp8fsvR_kVFlyvsKfIfYERN6dxjLdPyoPL=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNW5LVkxuaS1kTliYxPD_CeUdFPWSHkKQYeS_UH=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5wvrAbXrzVNMbO44Zi0Ywtcv1sqmScvpisYl9=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPs1pN8oAFW4TaurMEvaW0ysvcsBBoZU0XQ8Exj=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCMDdhTjlRRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x374f28a241f8a3aa!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDB07aN9QE%7CCgsIsYLSngYQ-JnKaw%7C?hl=en,111093772028749311132,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLcNRiW6YsStFPgXTi9UUspaDtet5MKlht5wxZ75dP_=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111093772028749311132?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,152
3443,Tanuki Raw @ Jewel Changi Airport,4,"Went there on a Friday for lunch with my family when I was on leave.  The restaurant is not crowded and we had all the attention from the waiter when we wanted to order the food.  The food also came promptly since there are only a few diners.  We ordered 3 freshly shucked oysters and 3 wasabi tartar oysters.  The oysters are fresh and thick and not surprisingly we  ordered more!  We went straight to the main course without any desserts.   We ordered Foie Gras Jewel Truffle Gyu, Charcoal-Grilled Char Siew Unagi and Spicy Mentaiko Don.  I must say the servings are not that big for big eaters but are sufficient for us as the ingredients are  overflowing the bowls.  Again, the ingredients used are fresh and that‚Äôs very important especially for Japanese restaurants.  We really enjoyed them very much and finished them in no time.  With good service and fresh ingredients, I would rate them 4-stars.   Price wise, they are not the cheapest but also not the most expensive Japanese Restaurants out there.

10120,Chinatown Seafood Restaurant,1,"Had probably the worst fried rice I‚Äôve ever eaten in my life and it was $16.80. Dry and bland like they forgot that oil and salt exists. It‚Äôs seafood fried rice but there were just tiny dry shrimp, crabmeat tiny balls and the driest fish chunks . I know it‚Äôs a tourist area but for this price this food is not even a tenth as good as any random zichar shop in Singapore. It‚Äôs a shame to serve this fried rice in sg.

Xiaolongbao was mediocre at best and also $16.80 for 6. Stingray was not quite fresh but edible thanks to the sambal we were able to ingest that horrid fried rice. Oh also the vanilla milkshake was $13.80?? The only decent thing was that the $8.80 apple juice was at the very least freshly juiced

8256,Under Der Linden Restaurant,4,"It was a last minute search nearing 2 pm on a weekday for a lunch place after a very active outing with our 2 young ones.  My partner searched this place and I called to check if they are opened in the afternoon.  Many restaurants/cafes have their kitchen closed from 2 pm to 6 pm so you can never be too careful.  The man answering the phone was very polite and friendly and I made reservations for a table on the spot.

A very Pet friendly restaurant.  Many patrons brought their pooches with them - Air-conditioned indoors.  If you are allergic to doggie fur, this might not be ideal.

I like the decor and feel of the place.

The menu has a slightly limited variety.  Food quality is good.  Kids meal portion is generous - 2 can share!

Good place to come back to try the rest of the menu although car park could be a challenge for weekends",2022-12-27T08:34:55.363Z,6,Patrick Lau,179.0,True,,,a year ago,,Lunch,,,Dine in,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCX3N1dWFBEAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBqCzzuU6xPJD-t93FMzLMLhqErDDeXTIg5zTQ=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOT9uEE-QEhsNOEQ0DhPfNgQCopFCNKExbkrScA=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVI5gT_IBZbGA07w1RTwtmbApETq5jx_s2-gNI=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPISt2Wt3gIEcupQvJaFikRNBeMKpcj8-xEY7QX=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9F2hWb0fVE7ZEbOKZlZ2KwnbRLImkZnlCEQNK=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOozb_Kf6SBaAXGgrHtt5jNs-Zc3fuUyzuK2yUB=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCX3N1dWFBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xd5927ea036ab800e!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICB_suuaA%7CCgwIr9yqnQYQ2KacrQE%7C?hl=en,106881591692184457438,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW_ofkBa6qfaAb38xVniPX1S9VI_1FpDW1L9BWJf1eBgJU=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106881591692184457438?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,159

Especially during special events such as birthdays and we always order their seafood, sambal sotong, sweet and sour seabass and stringray and we used to enjoy it so much. However, today when we came down all the food was disappointing, the stingray look so different, it was wet and very watery not the usual sambal bbq stringray that we ate where the sambal is slightly drier and the sambal look more darker. Their sambal sotong also came in looking very different the sambal was so watery that it looked no different from the sweet and sour sauce. Also, some of their cockles tasted bad like they were spoilt. Approached the staff to give our feedback not to demand any refund or replacement of food, but it seems like they were lazy to entertain and just said it was the same. However, looking back at all the past review and seeing the sambal stingray and now there is clearly a difference.

2838,No Menu Restaurant,5,"Food was really great here service was amazing. My utensils was changed after every meal.
The atmosphere of the restaurant was very homely, just like those I visited in Italy.
They took note that it was my partners birthday and surprised her. Very lovely staff!
Ordered the 6 course meal at $126/pax, was pleasantly surprised by the no menu food served. Price was a little steep but worth it.

4596,GO Noodle House Changi Airport T2,5,"The winning dish is the suan cai broth! Spicy level is definitely there, and the sourness matches it well. Occasionally you chee on that peppercorn and the numbness kicks in. Other superior broths are light in nature but it goes very well with the fish paste. Golden pillows are well done and do use it to soak up the broth for a better unami bite. They offer rice balls for desserts in either soy milk or ginger tea.

Taste wise quite close to the Pho we had in Vietnam. But can be better. The fried rice was really yummy, good for children. A little quiet on a Saturday night dinner. They have that familiar Vietnamese vibes. There is a public carpark opposite the building, next to a condominuim. During peak period, carpark was full we had to wait for a while.

Starters, on the other hand, were more interesting and reflect better on the Korean-southern Indian fusion.

Spent about $100/person with 1 drink each (compulsory), which was quite expensive for what we ordered.
