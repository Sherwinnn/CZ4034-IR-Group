7204,Jubilee Garden Restaurant,3,"Jubilee is a strange place indeed. A restaurant that's not really a proper restaurant per say. Looks like Safra wanted to maximise its rental income, so they simple compartmentalize the ball room into 4 sub dinning areas and leased them to Jubilee to operate as a restaurant! Good is that we booked 1 table and hv the whole sub dinning hall to ourselves. Bad is that next dinning room is hosting a D+D of sorts, so we had to put up loud noises as they had a karaoke competition for entertainment. Believe you me, wasn't that pleasant when you have to put up with extremely terrible loud voices screaming into the mike...not quite the SG got talent show!üò∞üò±

Foodwise, the quality is surprisely decent and not the usual mass produce type of food. Out of the 8 dishes on offer from the set CNY menu, I would say only the last 2 dishes....fried rice wrapped in lotus leaf n the red bean soup with glutinous rice balls are so so. The other dishes are good. Tasty and generous in portions. I liked the shark fins soup and stewed abalone with mushrooms especially! (Ok .... No disrespect to those anti shark fins activists...its just my personal choice). The prawn ball in oat flaks was also brilliant...piping hot, fresh n crunchy. The fish was humongous! Also quite fresh so would have been good if it was simply steamed instead of cooked with bean paste sauce. Still good nevertheless.

4 stars for food and 3 stars for the 'loud' ambience. 3.5 stars average. Perhaps good to visit the main branch in Katong.",2018-02-02T17:16:27.904Z,1,W.M.

The chilli mushroom was so oily it took me a second glance to understand if it is dry or gravy.
The schezwan fried rice was full of added color. Pathetic flavour profile.

Had ordered paneer tikka masala few days before (pic not attached) , the color added stayed on the fingertips till the next day.

This restaurant is using way too much color in the food hence the pics look delicious. Perfect case of ""Don't judge the book by it's cover""!

643,Esarn Thai Corner Pasir Panjang,5,"Tucked away in a corner of Pasir Panjang, this
cosy restaurant should be familiar to the folks working at Mapletree Business City as it is along a row of eateries just 10 min away by foot.
The cuisine and staff here are authentic Thai, attracting a diverse clientele here for its good food. At my visit, I spotted an Indian family as well as a group of locals with their Caucasian companion.
The food is redolent with the spices of Thailand, imparting that flavor that tells you, if you close your eyes, that you are in a little part of the Land of Smiles, despite knowing otherwise. No doubt, the chatter in pasa Thai adds to the illusion.
Portion wise, the food is served in hearty quantities and speedily.
We could not eat fast enough - the food was that tasty.

4012,Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ,4,"We ordered 2 sets of Japanese Wagyu beef and 1 set of Australia Wagyu lunch set. The Japanese set was better than the Australian set due to the thickness and marbling of each piece of wagyu meat. I think the $12 differences is worth it.

The usage of charcoal grill was a plus point as it provided the immense heat and smoke that had added the charbroiled, smoky taste into the food that gives barbecued meats their unforgettable flavor.

Occasionally, the sudden blazing fire from the charcoal added the extra fun experience.

1309,Shake Shack Junction 8,5,"Dinner Gathering with my friends. First time eating at a Shake Shack outlet (I kid you not üòä). Suakoo me have tried Shake Shack Burgers, but it‚Äôs the tapao version by hubs.

Ordering from the Self Service Kiosk was easy except for the part where I had to verify myself (cos I ordered ShackMeister Ale & Shake Shack needed to ensure I‚Äôm not under 18 üòâ)

Asked for help from counter staff who then gave me the passcode. I tried a few times n failed. Asked the same counter staff again who quickly came over to help me with the passcode.

Seems that different outlets have different passcodes, and he has just transferred from another outlet. He apologised for this, but I told him it‚Äôs ok.

I found the whole experience very interesting, albeit a bit time consuming. I initially punched in my age cos I thought that‚Äôs what they needed üòÇ

Ordered Shack Stack (Mushrooms & Beef Burger). It was really delicious! The ale was pretty refreshing too.

It was full house when I was there at 7.15pm. I wish I have gone upstairs. Cos after reading the reviews here, upstairs has nicer environment.

Shake Shack served complimentary water (self service) at a counter where you find serviettes and condiments. One also return the trays at the same counter.

I‚Äôm impressed that the service staff cleared the trays pretty fast.

Would I visit this Bishan Junction 8 outlet again? Probably if I‚Äôm in the area again.

In the small bowl, there was only 1 tiny slice of Chinese mushroom & 2 very thin slices of Chinese sausage. No garnishes at all inside. Maybe kitchen was too busy to add them? Rice was very plain without any fragrance. Told the male waiter that chef should give more ingredients and he replied that all were portioned out. Told him that was why should portion put more! Ate half of the small bowl only because rice was not nice at all. After 2 hours of the dinner I was very hungry that I got to eat the tarts they gave. Tart was a great idea and they were not bad.

7279,Samy's Curry Restaurant,5,"Samy‚Äôs curry house is indeed a local legend! The pappadums are crispy, but also a bit thicker than normal, giving good texture. For me, they‚Äôre best enjoyed crushed and scattered liberally over the mildly fragrant biryani, which won‚Äôt overpower the other flavors on the plate. The best thing on the menu, though, is easily the fish curry. A masterpiece of fusion cooking - an Indian curry bubbling away in a Chinese clay pot - its flesh is fresh, firm and clean tasting, but nevertheless permeated completely with the fragrance of spice. As some would say, all the curries here ‚Äúgot power one!‚Äù and your tongue will thank you after the burn!

As for the atmosphere, it‚Äôs cheap and cheerful; a casual eatery with friendly, attentive service. Not exactly the place for candle-lit dinners, but perhaps where you go with your buddies after a long business meeting for a couple of pitchers of amazing lime juice or cold beers.

9393,Neon Pigeon,4,"The last time I visited Neon, it was more than a year ago, and I remembered being disappointed at the quality and pricing of the food.

This time, I was pleasantly surprised because it does feel like they have found the rhythm back in their stride. The food was lovely, and the cocktails, even classic ones that we ordered, were on point.

The tapas generally were very well balanced in terms of taste. The outstanding dish of the night was the amaebi served with wasabi tobiko on top of a crispy piece of chicken skin. The combination was sublime, with the freshness and sweetness of the shrimp complimenting that oily satisfying note from the chix skin.

The hamachi sashimi was fresh, served over ponzu. The bone marrow with uni was done really well, served with decadent brioche, and just the right amount of savory and sweetness. I usually worry if the uni is fresh but the uni quality was exceptional.

The duck foie gras dumplings were yunmy, only complaint is that I can‚Äôt really taste the foie, but still a satisfying dish.

The chilean seabass was perfectly cooked with bits of crispy garlic, and overall a perfect ending to the meal.

They make a really mean campari sour, and their old fashioneds weren‚Äôt shabby as well.

2509,NAEUM Restaurant,5,"Today, we dined at NAE:UM and ordered the classic menu of Episode 5 with both half wine pairing and non-alcoholic pairing. I must say that everything from the service, taste, to presentation was impeccable. My favorite dish of the night was the BBQ beef dish, which was extremely juicy and flavorful. It is probably one of the best beef dishes I have had in Singapore.

What impressed me the most was the amount of thought put into pairing each drink with each dish. The pairings complemented each other perfectly. One of the staff members highly praised one of the pairing wine, Joseph Faively, and that it is his favorite wine, and I could very much see why it was his favorite.

As a cherry on top, the staff left us alone after serving us the celebration cake, which was a great touch as my companion and I enjoyed being able to enjoy our own space. The only criticism we have is that the sparkling Jasmine tea was a bit rough on the throat and not to my taste.

Overall, I came in with high expectations for NAE:UM and left very impressed with the experience.",2023-04-04T14:16:55.887Z,1,JW,16.0,True,,,11 months ago,,Dinner,,$100+,Dine in,5.0,5.0,5.0,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc2JtS1VnEAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2Tq611i1wBRXVArI7yquan_8e9lBVIsv1zhDt=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOoJwpJxwc5kUm_Zbk1fEAdhAAuiHso3GhXyDh7=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWd5hzG075nau3mDzmaftDkhnfu81Bi2qzydQI=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5VqJvnvo4uLNbTiiVS63VvgXzcpxv-jTY7Zwy=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLgVx6fsjp0aQmCGt3_Lf7N2PV8gITrLFOVE5j=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYS1p0ACNX1IUAY1naCmCXAl1u9vGkfocfU3am=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM55dtMYoi_vA3EojoP5n8Yf2UqTSje_0Q8FlZp=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSxpCPbDl7KCox7vNSHi2IsE5lobN9OTkxsDyS=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6lBcqNxp5M6jvw7Y74uAHOiJXUAKy2tBKKnHl=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrgvRG1SmpfSbJ2cRWy00y9zjIlO4peqO5leo7=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZnY9lS8YYVp0HiOkIO2Ct_E1HlQ3VdsbhJKFr=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSc2JtS1VnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x545f5c292d13e6f5!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICRsbmKUg%7CCgwI1-KwoQYQ0LqypwM%7C?hl=en,101194815918501076604,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUf0oRxhMYkZr67-99xXmrn6xPuWn6ReHYIRRFcAel-Y8I=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101194815918501076604?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,194

4394,Old Lai Huat Seafood Restaurant,3,Found this place after many years! But I must admit that I was a little disappointed. The fried balacan fish was still very good. Crispy & flavourful. Just don't look at the oil :p. Crispy baby squid was the best dish of the night. Black pepper crayfish was üòî. It's dry & quite tasteless. Deep fried fritters was expected. The rest of the dishes we ordered were nothing spectacular. Perhaps I was expecting a lot more as it was one of my favourite Tze char places many years back when they were still at Kallang. Do make a reservation if you are planning to visit. It's very popular with limited seating.,2022-05-03T12:07:46.315Z,3,Vtigaa Vtigaa,91.0,False,,,a year ago,,,,,,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyb083cFd3EAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJVw9K3Xn445wmv6fmR2Sc35Wc0v_mnHdnN5RY=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXVKhwkHoNGhT4M89j9NlKBNdi7MHNit5zI_fc=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFC1txDjekf_1xcNewUQQpKQBCD807S_e5CV8C=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyb083cFd3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xedc965ede1e7b13e!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID2oO7pWw%7CCgwIkrbEkwYQgMrDlgE%7C?hl=en,115070912373537254001,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUuoAqDHtgyrw8LIERT9Ik4Go-Ec7UG7ONYFdueBJ6kpA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115070912373537254001?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,111

1789,Ho√†ng H√¢u Vietnamese Restaurant,5,"Was looking for good food near SGH and found this place by chance. Would highly recommend to come here for a homely Vietnamese food. Below are my unbiased review:

The Lemongrass chicken skewers are really tasty, juicy and tender. The portion is also big.

Eel porridge is special and taste really nice and comfy especially in a rainy day.

Chicken Pho has a light broth that still encompass all the flavours. So if you prefer stronger taste, you might find it bland.

Fresh spring roll is fresh and good too, big in size! The sauce that comes with the spring roll is also unique and tasty.

Pork Bun Cha is a flavourful fish with fresh vegetables, sauce that is light with a tinge of sour, coupled with the pork meat patty that‚Äôs well flavoured (but a little hard for my taste).

The prawn crackers has light prawn taste and not oily, those who prefer lighter prawn taste will like this one.

For drinks, Vietnam coffee is a little light; the lemon grass is nice but is sweeten.

Service is very homely and they are Vietnamese who speaks chinese.

Would be back again for sure!

3483,White Restaurant (Tampines Mall),4,"Relatively new kid on the block. Decided to give it a try and I think one of the bosses was very friendly and courteous to the diners and was really making sure the diners enjoyed the food.
Quite crowded on a weekend morning even when it just opened for the day. Ordered the small prawn noodles, big prawn noodles and the big prawns zuke. Also had the prawn roll and the fried tofu.
The starters selection was very limited to only 4 items, would hope they can expand the selection someday. The mains serving was quite generous, and also like many have mentioned it's more on the expensive side. The broth is different from the prawn noodles and the prawn zuke, the prawn noodles broth had the pork ribs flavour as well while the prawn zuke was purely prawn broth which I enjoyed more. The serving for the broth in the little teapot was not a lot, and the staff came to give me another refill which was then just sufficient for the dish. Was a wise move using short rice also, making the dish very tasty.
I personally liked the fried tofu but the prawn roll was nothing to shout about. I guess the portion is quite big so I don't see people ordering loklok.

4807,Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao,5,"Seeing the steak restaurant next door priced at 32.9 dollars, I immediately decided to dine at Crystal Jade.

A bowl of hot noodle soup must be the warmest treat for passengers traveling on planes or connecting flights. For diners who don't eat pork, you can order the beef brisket noodles and shrimp dumplings.

ü•©Beef Brisket Noodles
The soup base is reasonably rich, without any surprises, in a typical Chinese culinary style. The beef and brisket pieces are quite large, making it more satisfying than scallion oil noodles.

ü•©Shrimp Dumplings
These are large shrimp dumplings, following the Cantonese style. The dumplings are a bit dry, suitable for quick meals.

ü•©Bamboo Shoots
This seems to be a specialty side dish at Jade Kitchen, ordered by almost every table. However, it has a peculiar taste, with too much sugar, resulting in less saltiness. It's the kind of dish where you can feel a novice chef trying hard to cook, but no matter what, they can't achieve a consistent and flavorful seasoning. However, when eaten with the rich soup-based noodles, it creates a unique combination. It's a magical dish and a specialty of this restaurant. But at 8.8 bucks
the price seems a bit high, considering you get only a small portion of bamboo shoots, around 100g.

If you only eat the noodles, it might offer better value for money.

2548,Majestic Restaurant,5,"Highly recommend this place for wedding for small (70-100)pax weddings. We had our wedding here in July and it was great!

Food: The restaurant allowed us to customise our own menu. All the dishes on the actual day were luxurious and delicious. The portions were generous and the presentation of the dishes were a feast for the eyes. Our guests loved the food!

Cost: The cost per head of S$150++ was really worth it for the quality and quantity of our seven course meal. The minimum spend required for booking the whole venue is also a reasonably achievable amount for a small wedding.

Coordination: The floor manager Doris Wong was helpful, accommodating, and kind. She helped us iron out many stressful hiccups before and during the wedding, and we are really grateful for her to help to create a smooth-sailing night.

Flexibility: The venue allowed us to rent our own sound system, set up a band, and do our own decorations.",2023-08-21T06:05:51.602Z,2,YY,47.0,True,,,6 months ago,,Dinner,,$100+,Dine in,5.0,5.0,5.0,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwbFotZ3RBRRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2guuTO2uxgU9oJKF28iv5M38xcX0pTbBzhkzw=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhxz-yAHEKq51Y12ET5gZxneBAIOIU5j012Rku=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-a-YJ7H6c824dFNqALRQal_AtvK18a8HDZahm=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxZEVLZCp5oIXrDGTuHGtseWZjjlnEVjydeQPd=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipND537I6syqnpXzNVdWqIb7JA2V2tAP6Aw1S1hX=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3ilikzP96GIXvE_LoQ5tmaLe93ObOXHuFneMt=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwbFotZ3RBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x79acd6b99b2f3477!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICplZ-gtAE%7CCgwIv_2LpwYQuKCLnwI%7C?hl=en,101443789417759529452,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXgaJoHAbJkbzUm5l1NBpzcvIHt7tDh4MiE5LrFVHtqRno=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101443789417759529452?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,161
