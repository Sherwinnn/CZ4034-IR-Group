9433,Fu Lin Men Chinese Restaurant (National Service Resort & Country Club),1,"Most horrible experience ever. Made a reservation on Quandoo, went down and they told me Quandoo made a mistake because they are fully booked. Our booking was for 7pm and we arrived at 655pm. There were 3 big tables empty at that time. Told me it was for 730pm reservation. If they had let me in at 7pm, some other tables would have been done at 730pm. A family came in later than 730pm and apparently knows the manager. Manager ushered them to the empty at the front. They seemed to dislike the table or for some other reason wanted to change their table. Manager moved them to another empty table inside and suddenly we now have a table. What kind of reason could it be that when a family switched seat there was suddenly an available table? It means that there was a table available all this time? And they waited 45 min to give us a table?

So we finally sat down and ready to place our orders. Waited 15 min to have our orders taken by apparently only the managers can take order. But at this point all the managers suddenly disappeared.

There were flies flying around and I even killed one on the menu. We saw someone‚Äôs Peking duck getting served and they dropped the cracker on the table. The waitress picked it up with his bare hands and put it back on the plate. That was when we know we had to get out of there. We waited 45 min for a table despite having a reservation, 15 min just to have someone come to us to take order. 1 hour for nothing.

Overall a very bad experience and will never be back without even trying their food. They blamed the app but it is on the restaurant to at least have the courtesy to call the patrons and let them know? It is Mother‚Äôs Day and everywhere else is fully booked. Where do they expect us to get a table?",2022-05-08T12:14:40.873Z,1,Wanyi Chia,6.0,False,,,a year ago,,,,,,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyck15amJBEAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8WE8uu7ctUbEjSfxgSg3h5pB_TnhQP2tdSDd8=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOa_6s5B8vfnpz2HdM8B8xajoZkgkeRaVJ_Q_BP=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyck15amJBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xede06fb4f9278e4c!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID2rMyjbA%7CCgwIsOjekwYQsNPeoAM%7C?hl=en,108780584033395180987,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVNAo5uSdK42jpBiqkpUS-q1BpFi6E9r1bNOYKfPMCv6dM=s120-c-rp-mo-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108780584033395180987?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,336

10479,Fico,4,"Food was delicious Italian flavours, but nothing too special. The focaccia with tomatoes was fluffy and fresh. The white ragu pasta was flavourful. Desserts were good too, only found the burrata gelato not to my liking although the recommendations suggested to get it. It was more salty than sweet for me. Service was amazing though.

2918,Z√©n,5,"Really worth the hype and the crazy price tag?

Absolutely yes!

This is an outstanding culinary experience not to be missed. First and foremost, the food is world class. Certainly one of the strongest 3 Michelin star menus I have had in recent times. All dishes were complex and multi-layered in their sensations, yet utterly delicious.

I also really enjoyed the flow of the dinner, starting at the ground floor with some excellent choice of bubbles, first nibbles and the now iconic showcase of ingredients, before moving on to the main dining room.

The wine list seemed well curated. Apart from the obvious super high end choices there was a decent range of more modest options. We had a Savagnin from Jura and a bottle of German Sp√§tburgunder, both excellent and great value.

The sommelier and the whole team were just a delight to interact with.

1271,Parker Korean Restaurant,5,"I take personal issues with keyboard warriors that has zero empathy to the elderly owners

Ignore all the reviews that critique at the elderly couple service standards. Both are in retirement and working everyday in a F&B (widely known to be gruelingly laborious) and running the whole operations+kitchen entirely on their own. Cut them some slack. Once, the couple had forgotten my request to top-up the side dish, but you don‚Äôt see my throwing a hissy fit. Be an adult and try to help them so you can get what you need, rather than retreat into your own shell, not get what you want and whining about it later

Have more empathy. What do you stand to gain by destroying two elderly livelihood who are trying to make an honest living. Stop trying to ruin honest businesses with this toxic cancel culture nonsense.

On the main topic - food critiquing:
(+) Food is great, one of the best Korean food in the area. Authentic and reminds me of my days in Korea. Nothing in Singapore comes close to authencity of the Korean food I vividly remember

(-) Food selections are few, not a Korean BBQ place if you‚Äôre looking for one but sells Korean cooked food

5711,Sin Ming Roti Prata Faisal & Aziz Curry Muslim Food,5,"Sin Ming Roti Prata serves up very well done pratas in a coffeeshop that has a decent selection of foods. Their menu is extensive boasting 19 different sorts of prata (whether they are available all day, I'm not sure)!

Ordered 1 egg and 1 kosong today and paid $3.30 for that. A look at their cooking process shows 4 people around the prata grill, 2 'shapers' and the main prata-flipper whom I assume is the boss, leading his other subordinate over the grill. They also seem to cook it slower, and with less oil used compared to other establishments.

The kosong was served fluffed up, whilst having a decent enough amount of crispy parts. The egg prata felt like i was biting into a soft pillow of dough and egg. Very enjoyable indeed! Their dough has a tinge of sweetness to it too - I would know since I have my pratas without sugar or curry. Honestly, they are one of the better prata shops around, and their daily morning crowd is proof of that.

Also disappointed with owners response - why not accept failings which are obvious from the pictures rather than blaming customer! Shame manager wasn‚Äôt present but on reading response not sure how would have helped. Rival accusation is frankly rediculous and slightly embarrassing!
Pham Quyen restaurant did seduce us with lovely looking baguettes in the window and we relished the prospect of some pho and banh mi. Sadly despite the numerous baguettes and cooked chicken on display (see photo) was informed that as there was only one chef the restaurant had stopped any orders. I mean seriously no one else other than the head chef could put together the sandwich. The mood wasn‚Äôt helped by the 45 min wait for a bowl of average pho and minimal beef, which I was told was down to a very large online order. I think this place would benefit from prioritising customers in the restaurant and cutting down the menu to banh mi and pho - seems odd to me that ever since the old manager left they have decided to extend the menu. Would like to say that this is a one off but had a similar experience. A few weeks ago!

502,Vineyard,3,"Can‚Äôt decide to give two or three stars.

Unfortunately the food was served really slowly on the day we went (Saturday night).

We ordered risotto, duck leg confit, an appetiser and two drinks. The duck leg confit took more than 40 mins to arrive. What was disappointing was 1) the table next to us received their duck leg confit before us even though they arrived later, 2) when it was finally served to us it was small and burnt. As we were too hungry we decided to just eat it anyway, but one of the staff saw the duck and offered to change it for us. If it weren‚Äôt for the staff we will be giving two star for this review instead of three.

Our dessert also took longer than expected to arrive (almost 30 mins after we asked for it to be served, even though we placed the order when we arrived).

2300,ÏòàÏïΩ YeYak Korean Restaurant,3,"Food was okay. Portion was small. Definitely overpriced, especially considering the ulu location. Generous spacing between tables though.
We ordered 2 pax set menu ($60) which was corn cheese + spicy stir fried chicken + deep fried pork for two people. We had to buy burgers on our way home for the dinner again. I‚Äôd rather going to other Korean resraurants in the main road at Tanjong Pagar for the similar price to get more proper dinner. It is far from everywhere and located  in the hawker center building. But still more expensive than other stores in the better location‚Ä¶
The taste of foods was seriously, just average Korean. Nothing so special. Perhaps I expected too much after seeing the hypes in the google review.
The atmosphere was impressive though. It has a retro-Korean vibes with thoughtful touches of music, lights, and furnishing items. Tables are pretty well-spaced from each other, not like some Korean restaurants that make you eating squeezed by each other.
Oh also be aware that water is not free here. When we sit down and ask for ‚Äòwater‚Äô, they served the cold barley tea. I thought it‚Äôs nice as some authentic Korean restaurants serve barley tea rather than just ice water.

This is the only place which is offering pure north Indian taste in north Indian dishes. I saw restaurants in Singapore where North Indian food was being cooked in coconut oil or I could say in South Indian style but here it was not the case. Cook here is really a master.

I was in Singapore for a month and for almost every day I choose this place for my lunch.

7038,Good Bites,3,"Service is good here, a malay lady was very attentive to our table when we require service. However, despite the high rating, food fell short of our expectation. Description of the physical menu and menu in the ordering page differs which made us feel shortchanged. Food is pretty pricey too while the quality was just not that great. Presentatiom could be better too,especially for the fries.

Ordered the following and here is my take:

Lamb chop - tasty and well cooked. Mashed potato is well seasoned too! Do share this dish though as you might find the lamb surfeiting after awhile.

Burger - was ok but patty was not well cooked. Could do with more sauce.

Chicken steak out - was ok, not the best chicken. Note that this does not come with calamari as per order page's description. Please update!

Strawberry latte - just a disappointment. Literally strawberry milk with shot of espresso. When mixed, it doesn't compliment each other. Can't taste the coffee too. For $10+ after gst? Just no.

Spicy chicken and fries appetizer - chicken is not even spicy the least bit :/ would have been good to have chicken coated with some spicy seasoning powder or sauce.

Overall, it was ok but there are better cafe hangouts. Location is quite a distance from bishan mrt too but good if you want to grab a meal after a workout. Place is quite squeezy too so it's not wheelchair-friendly or kid-friendly if your kid needs a baby chair.

Would i come again or recommend this place? I'd say please reconsider if it's for a celebration. Casual dining is fine but don't have very high expectations.

Need to improve on food quality control and the speed of food delivered...I ordered on 11:35 but I am only able to start eat at 12.02pm and in between the customer surrounded me is less than 10person.

He cannot control himself with the frustration on his facial expression, he seems too busy, all the tasks was delivered half way, for example, he didn‚Äôt bring me to the table, but point a table and told me I can sit there.
The menu does not have photo to provide reference, so I asked him for his recommendation, he mentioned 3 must try, but I can tell he is thinking we are wasting his time.
Apparently he is not the only one doing that, the other waiters are busy too, when we wanted to ask a waiter to help us fill up water, they pretend they did not see.

10136,Gaig Singapore,4,"Purveyor of high-end Catalan cuisine. The offered tasting menu purports to be an overview of the restaurant's offerings, but has some notable misses. Service is attentive, though slightly pushy, while ambience is excellent on a quiet midweek night. In all, given the variable quality of the tasting menu, I would probably recommend going for ala carte versions of dishes you are actually interested in eating.

Liked:
- Galician octopus and pork belly. Honestly the best thing we had, and is unfortunately not included in the tasting menu. I think it should be - it's an excellent and easily-portioned showcase.

- Of the tasting menu:
- Amuse bouche was suitably amusing: a shot of unseasoned yet highly fragrant mushroom stock.
- Salmorejo soup with jamon ice cream was an interesting starter, though I couldn't really taste the jamon in the ice cream.
- Of the tapas courses, the croquette and bomba were standouts, especially the surprisingly spicy and piquant sauce underlying the latter.
- Stuffed Cannelloni. The presentation (a single sad-looking cannelloni spooned over haphazardly with a thick sauce) is unappetizing, but it tastes pretty good.
- Catalan creme brulee was excellent and a satisfying end to the dinner, as were the petit fours served after as a nice gesture commemorate our special occasion.

Ambivalent:
- Of the tapas courses, the toast-based tapas (the jamon and the anchovies) had toast that was a bit too crispy - when you bite into it, the toast breaks up and gets all over the table. In the case of the jamon, because of the way the jamon is shingled, it's all too easy to end up eating a whole piece of ham with your bite of toast, so that you're left with excess toast and no ham at the end. Basically the mechanics of those dishes doesn't quite work.
- Seafood Fideu√† from the tasting menu. Carabinero prawn wasn't the freshest, and the short-cut noodles themselves had a sort of rubbery overfried texture while not being as flavorful as they looked.
- Crispy suckling pig with strawberries from the tasting menu. The suckling pig is good, if normal, but the presence of fresh strawberries strikes me as odd. Thought it would be good as a compote or something.

Disliked:
- Apple and Fennel salad, separately ordered. Honestly very meh; the one-note vegetal quality of the fennel overpowers the dish, burying the taste of the apple. A dish that doesn't really come together.",2023-12-21T09:16:06.883Z,1,Colin Chan,299.0,False,,,2 months ago,,Dinner,,$100+,Dine in,5.0,4.0,5.0,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWLTZ2ZllREAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIwASEfz8JvzTeL0HlyY-oa636gsfJGMZ1xccJ=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkKaY5j1C0xsEyPSJJDedIdTG_RP5l9ax684PL=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNeKbr7gvnantrWVxB6_BRjSyDXIcXjqr-OsZyc=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJqH4UBG89_05W2lJVCteKPnvAH-R9dTVEtcwK=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVQMeJLKhutkXqTAh7KEsItHDGYhn666mP5-cd=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrwVoWAh5m_1XpVbjQMjEPFVlyBwHt0ZcHc6Sg=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOZahRkUrcXqvUHCQGGKEPQdNy3bRz_1JPQYky=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXggR2BoWZYpMbTNcSSKEJeB1_9ljVEGx-kmVh=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKK0To0EAAIgbpJilHi41Z7W6DSJuywzxt8bIb=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWLTZ2ZllREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x6387fcf3dbbebfbe!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDV-6vfYQ%7CCgwI1oSQrAYQgKCSpQM%7C?hl=en,107951074976008996072,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJxWXJHoOnQ3_KXdWujnz0f0gX3YE9s9LPh2-xVO48F-Q=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107951074976008996072?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,408

4492,Brotzeit German Beer Bar and Restaurant - VivoCity,4,"Indulge your cravings for authentic German cuisine at Brotzeit.

3690,Rhubarb,4,"Visited in Jul 2023

The last time I had visited Rhubarb was 4-5 years ago. So a revisit was a long time coming. Good food and great service as always. There are 3 options/dining experiences you can choose from. I went for the most comprehensive one - 3 starters, 1 main with chef‚Äôs premium ingredient and 1 dessert.

While I can see how Rhubarb has been able to maintain its 1 star for so many years, I struggled a bit to find some key differentiating factor versus other French contemporary Michelin places. Good food nonetheless.

3726,Silver Shell Cafe,5,"Visit Date: 19 Nov 23

This was a busy evening at the Silver Shell Cafe. When we made the booking about 6 hours earlier, the restaurant reservation concierge was not sure if we could be seated inside. A month earlier we had a quiet dinner at the same pace but it was so warm and sultry, I did not enjoy either the ambience or the food.

Today we had opted for their buffet sitting inside and it was wonderful!
We were served by the same Thai lady who had served us a month earlier. She was very attentive and accommodating.

The Sunday theme was ""Singapore good Ol' Days"" and Boy! Was that Good!. The spread was exhaustive!
There was a salad bar, cheese, bread and charcuterie, a small spread of sushi, seafood station with clams, scallops, prawns and mussels.
At the Indian counter there was a delicious tandoori fish  along with a reasonable spread of veg and non veg options.
In the live satay station, beef and lamb satay were the best. There was a spicy sambal prawn to die for. The roasted lamb was ok. They also served a coconut chicken ( don't remember the name) which was the tastiest with rainbow coloured rice.
On another end of the hall was roasted duck, char siew, olive rice, chilli crabs and many others.I cannot even name all.
The dessert bar was quite exhaustive too. The bread pudding was very good and so was the creme brulee. The gula melaka sago was a little bland in comparison to others. There were assorted tarts cakes and fruits. The  pandan kaya and lapis cake were very good
We had shiraz to go with it all. Wine by the glass was quite comparable price-wise to any other city restaurant.
Delicious food in a great ambience. it was priceless family time.",2023-11-19T14:55:13.643Z,0,Barnali Roy,31.0,True,,,3 months ago,,Dinner,,$100+,Dine in,5.0,5.0,5.0,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsdm8ydjFBRRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRDt5gzKVYnWUPLinWb3EMWx8qFyy9jbK87opB=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNd9Qwe55r4tfa375acQuw7wzN4Mca6QcI0cwbj=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVdN0_hLLOBJ5Epiy_VPIeShC1b_3hh_B1g-Ta=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOm4Mdjstd9_1fVDgWVJphDxUMM8_HIO-SlG1G=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPokIa4gafJBX_SApN7IkcM4OhsFGYzwu_85tEh=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsdm8ydjFBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x46ac8b6c0aab7ed8!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIClvo2v1AE%7CCgwI0cPoqgYQ6Iz6sgI%7C?hl=en,108647109946352493238,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJh4qQOZhX2uKqKlscja1pEEAjG9Hzs8YzhnikXNu_Y=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108647109946352493238?hl=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,306

3072,Teahouse By Soup Restaurant @ Century Square,3,"Food came relatively fast with the exception of the Teochew olive rice. We checked with the server multiple times regarding the order but she brushed us off with ‚Äúit takes time to steam‚Äù without even checking with the kitchen. After an hour of waiting we decided we had enough and asked to cancel the rice if it was not ready and it turned out that the kitchen did not even prepare it as there was a glitch in their system. The staff was not apologetic at all and merely said she would cancel the order while the other staff who took our order came to apologise as she did not check with the kitchen and assumed that they were preparing the food.
