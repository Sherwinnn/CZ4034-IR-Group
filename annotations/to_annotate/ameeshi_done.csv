Positive,"We were so excited to eat so the photos are taken when we were halfway in. We chanced upon this place after work nearby - We ordered 2 Tempura udon (which includes fried tempura ebi, salmon, pumpkin and some enoki mushroom), dragon boat maki and a yuzu sake. The udon was amazing, soup tasted really light but flavourful with the hint of the mushroom. Noodles were cooked to a good texture and the tempura was not too oily at all! It was really comforting on a cold rainy night. My partner seldom finishes soup in soup dishes but he DEMOLISHED the whole udon.

The dragon boat maki was amazing as well, the ebi was cooked so nicely (not too oily, flour was not too much) and the salmon on it was a great addition. Very well blended taste and honestly i‚Äôm still thinking about it üòãü§§

We initially wanted to order  highball to try, but the lady boss (I assume) recommended us a yuzu sake that she had just brought in. It turned out really good and went so well with the food we ordered! She got another glass of sake (which she additionally shared with us it‚Äôs of a higher tier that is also yuzu but sweeter) That one was ü§©ü§©ü§©‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I wanted to find out what brand/type was it but she was busy. (She offered as goodwill too cause another waiter accidentally spilled my glass while he was cleaning up, hope he didn‚Äôt get scolded too much for it!!! Hahaha)

We were also then served barley tea FOC - she mentioned it was refreshing after drinking alcohol and she was right. Commendable that she is very familiar with providing her customers the best experience there. Would recommend and definitely will come back again!! It‚Äôs just 3 mins walk from lorong chuan MRT exit B. Super convenient. I have also noticed there‚Äôs a lot of regular customers coming in. Not sure about the sashimi and chawamushi, but I will definitely try it again when i‚Äôm back. ü§©"
Positive,"Really great Spanish food at reasonable prices. I especially liked the grilled iberico pork secreto, the aubergine with honey, and the seafood paella. Service was good and staff were friendly. I‚Äôll definitely be back to try their other dishes soon!"
Positive,"Food range is amazing, food equality is slightly above average. Down side that there are peak periods which will be hard to get seats during. But other than that, an often patron."
Positive,Nice ambience - the room was well decorated with Christmas carols and accompanied with Christmas carols. Delicious food - the food items on the menu did not disappoint us at all. Great service - thank you Kenny Yeo and the staffs for providing such great service.
Negative,Ordered on Deliveroo and food arrived 50min late. Contacted Deliveroo but they said delivery handled by restaurant so was unable to track and also unable to contact restaurant. Finally food arrived after 50min late. Overall quality is ok still warm but naan was understandable soggy as it was wrapped in foil.
Positive,"their coffee pork was the best to be, but prices have gone up, size of each piece has gotten smaller‚Ä¶ the sambal kang king is still delicious"
Positive,"Crab could have been fresher, but overall still a good meal. Salted egg veg and their dramatic sweet & sour pork is something I‚Äôd gladly order again when I return."
Negative,"staff on site were cold and unwelcoming and seemingly more interested in their own conversations than helping customers. i was trying to pay but the two workers at the cashier in front of me were js chit chatting, i was standing there for 2 mins js looking at them before a third worker came to take my payment. other than that, it was my first time in awhile eating onsite at pizza hut so i was unsure of what to do, but the worker who was in the dining area was very short and cold with his answers and made the whole experience so much more unpleasant. not sure abt other pizza huts, but dont go to the one at bedok mall. not worth the money as it is expensive + horrible service."
Positive,"Loves the soup. The soup has good variety and tasted really good. The restaurant is very generous, offering a one time free refill of soup. One can just have the soup and rice as the soup is very nutritious."
Negative,50% discount Wagyu don is totally doesn‚Äôt worth it. The beef meat is difficult to bite and the taste is bad. The green tea is very hot and you can‚Äôt hold the cup for long. Won‚Äôt come back again.
Positive,"we had dinner here on 10 jan, and was served by the male manager. he was very friendly, helpful and efficient, making our meal here a very enjoyable one! the food was also very good."
Positive,"My husband had visited this restaurant today to get a takeaway, was outstanding and good. The person who took the order was really helpful in choosing my menu items as I had shell fish allergy. He even made sure to pack the condiments separately for me as I had shell fish allergy. The signature dish we tried was fish fillets in a slight curry, tasted scrumptious. We order Kang Kong , spring roll , Thai fried rice, signature fish and tom yum fried rice. Every dish was exceptionally good and delicious. I am definitely coming back here for my future Thai food cravings. My husband was flabbergasted by the experience as well. One of the best Thai food I have ever eaten at Singapore. Hands down the best!"
Positive,"I simply love this place and got to visit only days after the latest COVID restrictions got eased a bit. 3 years ago this restaurant want buzzing, this time it was a lot more quiet but with the quality of the food here - no doubt they will be back in no time."
Positive,Very fresh & yummy seafood. Ordered many dishes & all of them didn‚Äôt fail to impress. Will definitely be back for more =D!
Positive,"Ordered first time to try this new restaurant suggested by my friend. Good and tasty food at affordable price. The dishes tasted great especially their grilled chicken, fried rice and mutton soup. Nice to have new Indian food choice in Jurong area. Hope to visit and dine-in to try more soon as the restrictions lifted. Highly recommend üëçüëçüëç"
Positive,"If you want GOLD CLASS BRIYANK, come down to Swan Lake Branch! Not only food is good & value for money, I like their service staffs here. Never fails to greet & served with a smile!"
Positive,"A reasonably priced restaurant with good tasting Chinese food. The oil soaked croaker fish was super crispy. We crunch crunch crunch almost every part of the fish. The sauce was not too salty and just nice to eat on its own without rice. The braised brinjal was really flavouful and umami, best to eat with rice. Will definitely go back again."
Positive,"Inconspicuous. Surprisingly yummy, had the fried steak & gravy set. I enjoyed the ambiance!"
Positive,"Quick and attentive service. Drink orders came straight away after ordering off the online menu (scan from QR code). $10 pints all day is something they promote.
Food also came quickly. Big portions so make sure you come with a good appetite. We got the Fat Basterd and Philly Cheesesteak, both were really delicious and juicy. We also got Jalepe√±o Poppers as a starter which came with a chipotle mayo dip.
Everything was fresh, hot and tasty.
Service staff were observant and polite, clearing and serving promptly.
Vibe in the restaurant was nice and chill, old school rock music, chic decor.
Close to the Upper Thomson MRT Station, street parking right in front but mostly taken."
Negative,"Ordered dark chocolate sea salt frappe. It's too salty and sweet. Asked the manager and her reply was that the beverage is made from premix, the proportion cannot be changed."
Positive,"Thumb ups for this Hong Kong Cantonese-style Seafood Restaurant. Credits to their food quality, quantity and staff service.

Mr Adriano Lance,  Business Development Manager,  was very helpful, flexible & accommodating to my üë™family needs.

Accessible by public transport and carpark lots are readily available.

Our overall experience : üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç and we will return for more üòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑ"
Positive,Great food especially the pho and the wings. They are heavenly. Seems like they do not serve fresh spring rolls. I dun quite fancy the fried ones.
Positive,"While not all my family shared the same views and taste, I like the food and location. Fortunately it was a cloudy day, so I felt just nice at lunch there.
The public carpark was a bit far for my elderly parent. Is there a carpark at the premise although I doubt based on what I see.
Overall, a lazy afternoon there. Walk along east coast beach after lunch is so so relaxing"
Positive,"Ordered the butter chicken, dhal with the naan set. The chicken was tender and tasty, and the naan served hot and fresh. The briyani and egg fried rice were also tasty and moist!

The servers were also really attentive and served us well. However, the seating was a bit cramped with a full house. An otherwise pleasant experience."
Positive,This is such a hidden jem. You could get indian gravies with great taste and quality at a very low price. And they have a lot of varieties as well.
Negative,"Had a good dining experience about two to three years ago during the Covid period. Came back to Pixy for the second time for dinner.

We ordered three dishes - bouillabaisse, grilled iberico pork collar and grilled squid, squid ink risotto. In general, the taste of the dishes is decent but we had some issues with the freshness and texture of the ingredients.

The bouillabaisse consist of two pieces of cuttlefish tentacles, one scallop, two prawns, three pieces of mackerel and some clams. Some of the ingredients wasn‚Äôt fresh and we highlighted it to the chef. He claimed that the prawns were frozen. The taste was definitely not sweet (menu indicated that it‚Äôs sweet prawn) and was mushy. The clams tasted bland, overcooked and soft. This dish is a chef‚Äôs recommendation but I definitely wouldn‚Äôt recommend it.

The taste of the grilled iberico pork collar was nice but it was at least 50% fat. Have tasted many iberico pork collar before but never this fat. The accompanying sides were decent.

The grilled squid was nicely done. However the risotto‚Äôs in the grilled squid was like a paste.

Overall the ambiance and service was nice but all the three dishes were underwhelming. It‚Äôs also unusual that a restaurant of that size has only one chef and one server on a Saturday evening."
Negative,Initially food is great. Slowly standard drop. Last i visited and i got really cold dishes. Probably not coming back anymore.
Positive,"AMAZING JOKBAL that comes with a side of bibim naengmyeon and soup!! service was amazing too, and they were super accommodating to all my requests :‚Äù) will highly recommend!!! Was a super yummy dinner spot and all my friends enjoyed the food thoroughly! (In their words the jokbal was BUSSIN BRO hahah!)"
Negative,"We felt that it is pretty expensive considering that it cost almost $400 although there was neither fish nor crabs. The desserts were a letdown and not worth ordering. Yam paste served initially were not warm and we requested them to change it. The chicken wings were very ordinary and I thought a fast food restaurant can offer a better quality. To sum it up, it‚Äôs very unlikely we will return."
Positive,Great vegetarian indian food! Staff was friendly even when we were not very familiar with the menu.
Negative,Went during lunch hour and ordered famous white beehoon and silver fish spinach soup. Beehoon is delicious and rich in gravy. Spinach soup is a total disappointment. It taste like salt water instead of the broth soup.  Spinach is old and hard to chew. Will not recommend the soup at all. Price is reasonable at $8.50 for a plate of beehoon and $6.50 for the spinach soup. No GST or Service charge. Will recommend to packet instead of dining in as the bad ventilation in the express restaurant will makes you smell bad after leaving the place.
Negative,"One of the worst dim sum I had for the price range. Cheong fun is the worse, skin is hard and I can only taste soy sauce. My boy even commented that it tasted like spring roll. Roast pork bun skin is thick with little meat. Lastly, chilli sauce is horrible. Only century egg congee is lightly better. Never order the rice bun shown in the picture. It is the worst of all. For the price, I would expect much higher standard. Disappointed."
Positive,"Last night's dining experience at Rhubarb was amazing. The dishes were a brilliant blend of innovation and taste, showcasing Chef Paul's passion and expertise. Each plate was a visual feast, with flavors that surprised and delighted beyond expectation. The service team was the epitome of professionalism, exuding warmth and friendliness that made the cozy and elegant setting even more inviting. It is rare to find a restaurant where the ambiance harmonizes so well with the high standards of the culinary creations. This dinner wasn't just a meal; it was a memorable journey through exquisite tastes and textures. Rhubarb certainly deserves more than a mere one star. Thank you to Chef Paul and the entire staff for an unforgettable evening."
Negative,"Tried this place for the first time after reading some of the online reviews and checking out menu. As you can read from the multiple reviews here on Google, the food is good with a wide variety of items available. Unfortunately, they really struggle with the service element. In wanting to be specific, the general service was ok for me. Just 2 things really left a sour taste in my mouth after the delicious meal:

1. Communication: when ordering drinks, I had asked my server if plain water was chargeable. What I understood from him was that as long as the table purchased some form of drinks, e.g. tea, water would be complimentary. We thus believed this to be so until the bill came and the cashier said that I was misled and didn‚Äôt have the courtesy to waive the 3 cups of plain water we ordered.

2. Pushiness in ordering: as it was my first visit and not knowing the portioning of food in terms of small, medium and large dishes, I had to rely on the order-taker to guide me in terms of what was enough for our table. Unfortunately, even when I thought enough was ordered, she still tried to nudge me to order more and dessert as well. I drew the line before dessert and true enough when the food started coming, it was overwhelming. When we tried to cancel items that had not arrived, we were not allowed to. By the end of the meal, we had to takeaway 3 almost-untouched dishes to prevent wastage of food.

For first timers, do double or triple check if unsure about what is chargeable, and go with your gut instinct rather than just trusting the order-taker to order more than sufficient."
Positive,Excellent service and vegetarian food was amazing!!! Highly recommended.
Positive,"Been to a few outlet but never once left a review but this outlet is different, it worth a visit and money you spend.

Cant remember the Chinese lady name (will update in my next visa it), she just so sweet and very attentive to children especially for parent who dining here. Well done. Keep it up the good work. ü´∞üèª"
Negative,"Personally have never been a big fan of Raffles Town Club, especially with the ethical sagas that they have been put through in the past. Irregardless, find them very stuffy vs the newer Private Members Clubs in Singapore. Likewise, Miyabi, being the mainstay Japanese restaurant of Raffles Town Club, has this air of gloominess, age, and staleness the moment you walk in.

Coupled with the fact that only members can access the restaurant, there's automatically a discrimination towards a certain cluster of target audience.

It's probably good for family gatherings on the weekends, as you have private access to a teppanyaki space for yourselves. Prices are reasonable too, for the amount of food they serve as part of their teppanyaki sets. Get the lobster and beef set menu, and you should be sorted for the evening.

Food quality is good but not great. All else accounted for, I'm sure there are better Japanese restaurants around Singapore. This space reminds me of it being run like a passion project, not like a competitive f&b business in Singapore.

If you're looking for a space to chat and talk as a family dinner, this may not be for you, as you'll be sitting quite far away from each other, surrounding the teppanyaki hotplate. Go find your traditional sit down round tables."
Positive,"First time here. Made a Saturday lunch reservation which was confirmed via email by the Asst Mgr. Imagine my surprise when we arrived and was told that they do not have our reservation. Luckily, the place was empty except for us and another party.

We had menu 2. Food was tasty and comparable to similar items served in more atas cafes but at a discounted price. For soup, we were served with a chipped porcelain spoon. Please have the server check all cutlery before serving.

For the bakery located outside, it is advisable to have the payment and packing at the same location. The baked goods that I bought did not tally with the ones I received. They packed the baked goods behind the counter, bring it to the restaurant cashier for check-out. Customer will then procced to pay. There should be a verification step with customer to show them what was purchased.

Overall, I would return to try the dinner menu. Best of all, there's free parking on site. Everyone, pop by and give this place a try."
Negative,"The most horrible food. We ordered paratha, kachori and chola kulcha.
The kachori was stale and it seemed it was older than a week. The paratha were maid of maida and lacked taste. We had it throw the whole food. Disappointing!"
Negative,Waited 30 mins + for claypot rice. Turns out its just cooked plain rice heated up in a pot. Not worth the wait
Positive,Vegetarian food cheap and good
Positive,Good Indian food. Pre call order also available
Negative,"Ordered takeaway on a Sunday evening and waited one full hour despite placing our order at 625pm. The lady did warn us that the waiting time is 60mins before I placed our order so I guess that was somewhat fair.

However, none of the dishes was worth the hour‚Äôs wait. Food was very mediocre and super overpriced. The ten boxes in the photo was $184.

We had ordered Medium sized French Bean with Shrimp ($28!!!) and Medium Claypot tofu ($20+). There were barely any tofu and it was mostly gravy. The medium Prawn Paste Chicken was also $20+ for 9 pieces and the store didn‚Äôt have boxes with holes that allowed the hot steam from fried food to escape, so our wings were soggy and sad. The duck rolls which were supposedly a speciality at the shop was also odd tasting and didn‚Äôt really stand out for us.

Carbs wise, we got the medium egg Hor fun and medium crispy noodles. I don‚Äôt think there was much wokhey in the noodle dishes and it was pretty forgettable.

I would not recommend this place to anybody. You can easily get better, faster and cheaper Zichar at probably any other shop."
Positive,"Homely zichar restaurant nestled in a quiet corner in International Plaza.

I particularly enjoyed the salt and pepper pork ribs, beef bites, and the claypot sliced fish, amongst many others!  The claypot chicken is their specialty and its super tender and fragrant!   Would recommend!"
Positive,Same familiar magic of allium in a brand new avatar.
Positive,Laoban so nice!!! Highly recommended taste amazing too
Negative,"This is the worst Siam Square Mookata I've been to. Prices are higher than other branches and food quality is not good. The pepper dishes are basically soaked in a small amount of fine pepper. Look at the photo to judge for yourself. Service is also lousy when we told them our plate cannot even boil, they just say is ok and walked off. While our neighbouring tables all had boiling soup. The garlic pork... Can u even see the garlic? This is the first n last time I'll eat here. Avoid if you don't want to spoil your mood."
Positive,"Nice experience.

We had a long layover at the airport and treated ourselves to dinner to celebrate the end of our travelling journey.

Staff were super friendly and helpful. The view of the waterfall area was nice to view from where we were seated.

We got 2 rounds of cocktails and the sharing. Which we would recommend for those who are hungry! Worked out well for us. A whole lobster, a roll of your choice, burger of your choice and two sides of your choice.

Lobster was grilled and was nice but slightly lacking in that fresher flavour that I‚Äôve had other places.
They were also out of the chicken burger which we would‚Äôve liked to try.
Other patrons were a little bit rude, two people in T-shirts and younger seemed to annoy them. But we didn‚Äôt care that much. And the staff made us feel very welcome. Maybe seating a little further apart for the bar stools

Overall a nice experience for the food and drinks if you‚Äôre looking at spending some time in the airport area."
Positive,4/5üåü . Restaurant runs by local Thai. The food taste good and portion are big too. It is highly recommended to try their fried mango salad. Do visit them as they are running rebates in points for customer with their membership that can be use on the next visit.
Positive,"This prata shop serves really bad coffee, makes you wait too long to be served, but the prata is really good. Ordered the Onion-egg prata and the Cheese Tissue prata and they were delicious and above average compared to other local prata stalls. Prices were average in today‚Äôs standard and when they finally show up, the staff were really nice too."
Positive,"I would say this is the best herbal soup place I have tried. You can try pig stomach soup, black chicken soup, turtle soup with yam rice. However you can bring your own whiskey or cognac to add on the soup so to make it nice ! You can keep your bottle there and hey will give you a number to remember. The restaurant is clean and food service is great. Food comes fast and aircon is cold enough for you to drink the herbal soup without sweating ! Highly recommended and I will come again.."
Positive,"The restaurant is known for its authentic flavors and generous portions. The menu features a variety of dishes, from dim sum to noodles and rice dishes. The restaurant also offers a selection of vegetarian dishes. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, with a warm and friendly staff. The restaurant is also known for its reasonable prices and excellent service.good"
Negative,"The sesame oil chicken (with only the wings part) cost $26, the sambal sotong size is smaller than 5cents coin size and cost $15! It‚Äôs totally not worth it."
Positive,"One of my favourite food places in Singapore! :-)

The lady boss is always so cheerful, genuine and welcoming! Great service as always, just a little sad to see the prices going up a little more each time cause of inflation‚Ä¶ :‚Äù)

If you cook your own Okonomiyaki, you‚Äôre entitled to a 10% discount (which brings the price to $16.20++) which is nice since it‚Äôs quite a fun activity with instructions provided! I love being able to place endless amount of bonito flakes when I DIY~

The Potato Cheese Mentai is one of my favourites, though a little pricey at $12++.

The Garlic Fried Rice is not bad, but not as good as the Okonomiyaki and Potato Cheese Mentai."
Negative,I ordered them via food panda and I received a missing product and a expired product. Literally expired product.. I ordered vadai and they sent me Chilli chicken where I'm a vegetarian and 2nd order was chapati which they sent me an expired chapati..  Literally there were fungus in my chapati ... how can they be so careless... eat at your own risk..!!!!
Negative,My takeaway burger was cold and the cheese hasn‚Äôt melted :( the bun hasn‚Äôt been heat up too. Taste different from last time
,"Updated post, 29 Apr 23
We had a home lunch party for about 11 adults (7 non veg, 4 vegetarians) Ordered for a delivery through Tandoori Corner‚Äôs website. $347 incl delivery

The food arrived on time, still warm and well packed (briyanis were in plastic bentos and ala cartes were in individual plastic containers, naan wrapped in foil)

We took some poor pictures so can only post our delivery receipt to show our satisfaction. Everyone enjoyed the hearty and tasty meal and our party was a success! Thank you Surender and Tandoori Corner!!!!

Prev post Dec 2022
Been enjoying Tandoori Corner for years‚Ä¶ since I was an omnivore and have continued as a vegetarian. A long overdue review!

The menu is extensive, there is something for everyone.  Typically we come for dinner to enjoy the cool alfresco seating. We also used to cater with Tandoori Corner for our home parties and office functions (before covid) and everyone is happy.

But yesterday the lunch atmosphere was great too. We ordered the set lunches, generous portions for $10-12 each, add a drink for $1.

Do make a booking if coming for dinner, it can get quite packed!"
Positive,"5 course dinner, best dish was the Steam Seabass/kimbalor (don't have the picture)

The rest was so so only. I felt the prawns were quite salty though."
Negative,Food and ambience is good but they are quite short of staff. Difficult to get waiters attention especially if you are sitting towards the peripheries. Additionally kitchen also forgot 3/4 of our order so we had to wait and extra 45mins for it :(
Negative,"Ordered omakase cuisine for about 90sgd per pax. Most plates were good. I only wished the mains came earlier, as it was the second last meal - we were already too full by then.

The oyster was the star of the dish.

I felt that there was no need for the fried potato ball.

The tofu egg wasn't that nice.

The chawamushi was good but it had a layer of sauce that was sweet and sour which wasn't pleasant.

The crab sauce dumplings had too thick of a skin, and the fillings were not springy enough.

The mains which were the sashimi don and fried rice wagyu beef, were delicious."
Positive,"Been coming here at least once a week for the past 8 years. Good food, good people, good environment. Will continue to come here regularly for the foreseeable future."
Positive,"Great attentive service, burgers were juicy, but fries seem to have sat there for a while .. wasn‚Äôt the hottest"
Negative,Cheap and decent food but the chapati was ROCK HARD..... -.-
Positive,"Was craving for Japanese BBQ so went for dinner on Tuesday.

Food was good on a whole.

They seems to be a bit short handed. Serving was a bit slow but still acceptable.

A good place for slow eating and chit-chat session!"
Positive,"Blue Lotus consistently delivers a high quality menu. The chilli pomelo crab is a must have. Do make your reservation and let them know your intention. The crabs come in fresh every late afternoon.
The outdoor seating is a must book as well, the ambience is very enjoyable."
Positive,"If you know what Dum Biryani is, then this is the best place in Singapore for that dish. Highly recommended."
Positive,"Interesting concept of HK/Canto tapas. Food was good but serving size was quite small. A little too high on the price in my opinion. Drinks came in a glass filled with 80% ice, don‚Äôt know why they do that as it is only a can of Coke."
Positive,A beach club which does dinner service in an air conditioned restaurant section. Spanish styled tapas and mains dominate the menu. Extensive range of drinks including cocktails and wine. Food quality really good as well as service.
Negative,"Staff were friendly but like some past reviewers have experienced, they claimed that the prices on the menu were wrong when I questioned them on why some items were charged differently from what were stated. Food standard was below average."
Positive,"A non halal eatery. Have dined at marche for a good few times. All the while, they are well knowned for their rosti. Still one of the best after so many years. Crispy on the outside and soft inside. Pair well with the sour cream. Do expect to queue and wait for your turn and dish to be ready. Once you are at ordering counter..service is relatively fast. Menu clearly states what is available and TODAY'S SPECIAL. So, if you want to be served fast; think about what you want to order while in line before reaching ordering counter.

Dishes are generally made for 1 person portion. So maybe sharing is possible if you are in a group to taste relatively different food available.

Some food station practice ordering and wait for your food to be ready before collection using a buzzer such as pizza counter and pasta counter.

Dessert wise...only still can stomach in ice cream. LOVED IT!!!!!!!. very very nice, not too creamy.

Queue to be entered and served. Price wise..not the most budget friendly."
Positive,Food is amazing. The briyani is really good for the price point. Prata is crispy but not too greasy and the Maggie goreng merah was pretty good too.
Positive,"Service from all crew and food was excellent, atmosphere was wonderful. Do come and visit their outlet to enjoy the food and service"
Positive,Visit for the best Indian Food in Toh Guan Area
Positive,"You are in for nice ambient w gluten free food and organic wine feast !

We started off w gnocchi , and liked how simple it is . This continued w portobello w chimichurri sauce . And taking taste profile higher w the chargrilled cabbage . Going to the mains, we moist our palate w Ceviche then feast on lamb Picanha . As we enjoyed, a friendly staff introduced us to organic orange wine . In between, more friends joined us and we topped up w wagyu picanha and croquetas .

It is a joyful meal, indeed . Would come back again !"
Positive,Great ambience. Food and service is great as well. Excellent blend of nature and lifestyle at the outdoor seatings. Elegant yet cozy in the indoor seatings.
Negative,"Expensive food and small portion for brunch.
Drinks were pretty and tasted ok. Deco inside the cafe was beautiful.

We went with a dog and it rained really heavily.  When it was starting to rain, we asked the waitress for another place to dine, we were told there was no place we can finish our drinks inside the restaurant with a dog with us.
We tried to finish our drinks at the outdoor seats but the rain got heavy very fast.

We were only led to the patio by another waitress which is sheltered and at the side of the restaurant when my partner and I stand by the door of the restaurant due to the very heavy rain because the outdoor umbrella cannot shelter 4 people from the rain. We were drenched and standing there looking at the nice deco in the restaurant like the girl in the story of ""Little Match Girl"". Just nice that day was Christmas day.. So much feels.

Unforgettable day of brunch celebration for all the wrong reasons.

Won't return again."
Positive,"Beautiful restaurant near the sea which makes you feel like you‚Äôre on a vacation away from Singapore. Service was impeccable from the moment we stepped in, and every dish was beyond our expectations. Was also surprised that the prices were not exorbitant given the quality of food, service and ambience. Already making plans for my next few reservations (good to book 1-2 months in advance to get your desired weekend dates!)."
Negative,"Wait for ten minutes in the queue, when it was my turn to order, the macik asked me to wait for the chinese lady to serve me. however, the Chinese lady chose to walk away and left me standing there. I ended up walking away empty handed because they chose their customers. Not the right way in service line."
Positive,"Variety of dishes in the menu, the atmosphere was good but too dim inside makes me headache. Price is average.

Spaghetti carbonara was flavorful and creamy. The mix grilled platters worth its price as there were chicken chop, pork chop, lamb chop and sausage in it. The pizza was not bad, it had cheese, tomatoes, sausages and pineapples on it."
Negative,Prata is not crispy and overall soggy and not fragrant. One of my order was missed out and they subtly replaced it with a cheaper one without informing me.
Positive,"Tried a new restaurant close-by the CBD. Had the set lunch, and the food was not bad. My favourite item was the Cro√ªte aux Champignons ü§§

Pictured:
- Cro√ªte aux Champignons: Wild Mushrooms Ragout on Toasted Bread
- Mignons de Porc au Poivre Noir: Pork Tenderloin, Black Pepper Sauce & Potato R√∂sti
- Filet de Bar, Sauce Vierge: Sea Bass Fillet, Virgin Sauce & Seasonal Vegetables
- Coupe Romanoff: Vanilla Ice-Cream, fresh Strawberry and Chantilly Cream"
Negative,"$10.80 - XO carrot cake
$12.80 - octopus karaage
$11.80 - roast pork
$12.80 - braised pork belly with preserved vegetable
$15.80 - kailan 2 ways
$2 - plain rice
$3.50 - Thai iced tea
$2.50 - oolong tea

Our total bill for this place came up to $83.38, even after a card discount that took the signature carrot cake off the bill.

This place is incredibly overpriced. The place was empty when we went and the server seems nice enough, but the food ranged from average to bad.

The carrot cake was probably the best, but was average at best, like what you would get at dimsum places... Look at the size... That's 10.80++!

Octopus karaage was not crunchy and the portion was super small, while the sauce was like mayo, worse than sweechoon's kind of trashy sauce.

The kailan was just fried with floss on top... $15.80++! Are you kidding me?

The braised pork belly had so little pork that my friend had a piece each and I only had preserved vegetable. Just look at the pork in the picture... You can barely find any. $12.80 for preserved vegetable.

The winner is the ""Thai iced tea"" as it was described in the menu. It was clearly bottled tea.

This place borders on being scammy I would not recommend at all!!"
Positive,"Super happy to discover this gem of a place on a Sunday afternoon for late lunch! The ambience was awesome. It was not crowded at all which at first was slightly worrying to me, but after we tried the first dish that we ordered, the rest just kept getting better than the dish before! We had Cavatelli pasta with generous serving of squid, delicious carbonara cooked on a slab of cheese at the table, roasted octopus, and a shoulder of lamb that went excellently with toasted sourdough. The service was also fantastic, and Edward was very friendly and accommodating to our requests. It was a very satisfying and perfect slow lunch on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Will come back for sure."
Positive,"My family came to Poulet at Causeway Poulet for dinner around 7pm on the 29th of October, Sunday. The food was very delicious. Great ambience and service was outstanding. Special shout out to 2 of your staff especially Nur on being knowledgable on the menu and giving us top notched service. And Rai for being so attentive in providing us great service too. Will definitely recommend family members and friends to patronise Poulet. Kudis to Poulet for employing wonderful employees. Thanks again for giving us a wondeeful experience."
Positive,"The chicken is great and the service by the male manager is amazing. Can‚Äôt say for the female manager.

Wrap the chicken with the special ginger is must do at this restaurant.

Remember to order the olive rice to pair the dishes."
Positive,"This restaurant served one of the best foods around this vicinity. The hot pot steam fish was rather tasty. The grouper first was fresh. The savoury chilli crabs were marvellous. The vegetables and boneless pork loin were tender and juicy.
Overall, we had a sumptuous dinner"
Positive,Amazing quality food well presented and perfect service by Emilia and Nelly. We enjoyed ourselves very much. Will definitely be back next time ;)
Negative,The food is not taste the price is not worth for the food
Positive,"Another normal food court but not very affordable.

Coffee no so nice.

Sugarcane juice watery.

Duck rice pricey.

Papaya salad okay."
Positive,"Tried signature and is awesome for the comfort it brought . Staff are extremely friendly and accommodating . Thanks and keep it up . Space is however very tight from table to table , we have to move to another place to be able to enjoy the conversation better ."
Positive,"Tapas were very unique and tasty. I believe we had the grilled octopus and some anchovy + burrata cracker. Paella was nothing exceptional. Desserts (rice pudding and orange cake) were alright. If I were to go again, I would order just the tapas."
Positive,"The chilli prawn pasta was filling and tastes pretty good. The portion was quite generous and the chilli was adequately spicy.

I ordered the gula melaka latte and it tasted nothing like gula melaka. It tastes just like regular latte. Then, I had the the espresso ice cream which tastes nothing like espresso and more like milk coffee. Odd."
Positive,"It‚Äôs such beautiful that your neighbor have a Japanese food with very affordable price.
The quality was good and amount of the food also quite generous!"
Positive,"Nice place and ambience. The Staff service was very good also.

Food was good. ordered the beef sandwich but beef was quite dry. The staff offered to change the sandwich for us and we ordered the snow shell crab sandwich which was really tasty.

Just a minor feedback, we found a fish bone and some scales while eating the salmon sashimi. Not sure if that is normal for salmon sashimi. Might want to take note when ordering their salmon platter."
Positive,First time trying squid ink ramen here and it‚Äôs interesting! Love to have the broth here on cold days.
Positive,"Spacious and food was delicious.

Missed the cheechongfun timing (before 5pm?)

Anyway other dim sums were great. Siu mai, ha hao, xiao long bao were onestar Michelin worthy as expected. Juicy and filled with meat.

Food: 5/5
Price: 4/5 slightly pricey without bank promo
Vibe: 4/5"
Positive,"First visited, the ambience was a bit too dim when first walk in, my opinion slightly brighter will be good enough.

The ‚ÄúTokyo Hummus‚Äù is a very good choice that the bartender recommended to me. Lucky I do not miss it. The truffle mushroom rice was a bit creamy because it came with a sizzling hot pan.

The cocktail choice is awesome, and the bartender can be based on your favour and demand to create something for you."
Negative,"The food has gotten from bad to worse, and usually the safest food I‚Äôll buy it‚Äôs either Nasi Goreng or Prata, but today Nasi Goreng is as good as eating plain rice with Anchovies with Chilli. No absolute taste at all and what surprises me is that there‚Äôs a Mee found in the noodle , which explains that the chef didn‚Äôt even bother to clean the Wok before frying the following orders!!!!! This really upsets all of us!"
Positive,Always walked passed but never patron before. Today decided to give it a try since it always full house. Indeed it tasty & portion is reasonable. Will definitely come back to try their other dishes.
Positive,very nice place but hars to reach with oublic transport
Positive,"I would like to thank all the staff serving us as quickly as possible for our iftar.

The food was not delivered early before breaking of fast which is appreciated. I know that with this type of system will be bound to encounter delay on 1 or 2 dishes (which for us is the ala carte dish, Mee Hon Kong.) Nevertheless, rest of meal was nice except the Tom Yum Soup (tasted bland). Apart from it, we have a wonderful experience there.

Would recommend others to iftar there. Slightly pricey but for the service and ambience, it is well deserve."
Positive,"Great food, decent priced drinks with live entertainment. Very fun environment!"
Negative,"Pretty expensive local fare. But to be fair, the portions are pretty big. U can probably share a plate of fried rice or hokkien Mee but i think still expensive. The food is pretty OK but I thought it's on the oily side for me. Service as usual first class"
Positive,"About $49 for a pad thai, curry noodles, 2 drinks, and a salad to share"
Positive,"Ok wine, food of my companions looked sub standard (quesadillas, nachos). Only dish that people had good things to say about were the buffalo wings. Great place for watching sports though."
Positive,"Well prepared service crew Ezann! Thank you for recommending us the Christmas meal-for-2; the four cheese pizza üçï, strawberry frizz with passion fruit üòãüòã Will definitely recommend to families and friends ‚òÉÔ∏è"
Positive,"Remembered this Thai restaurant has been around for a long time. Find it very interesting, because you will have to scan the menu, which will lead you to the grab platform. Find it not so user friendly. ü§îü§î for customers who don‚Äôt have Grab app.. alittle hard to order.

The serving of the food was prompt. We prefer the clear Tom Yum Soup! ü•ò But will opt for seafood option next time. the portion for the egg omelette fried rice was superb, to feed 6 pax. We ordered the basil pork too. Not too spicy. Price I would say still okay!

Find the Thai milk tea and lemon tea alittle too diluted though. May not order their drinks next time.

Would say it is a nice Thai Zhi Char restaurant."
Positive,"Had a great 1st meal here. Food was amazing. Started with the salmorego tomato soup so rich. Beef and pork pasta cannelloni was recommended and glad we ordered it. Octopus with cauliflower was very tender. Fiduea was full of umami but maybe a tad oily, still very yummy. Other reviewers said the white wine sangria as refreshing, but I personally preferred the red wine sangria. Can't go wrong with either to be honest. Will be back again, maybe try the beef Wellington."
Positive,"Food is nice, we love everything we ordered. Crew was very friendly and helpful. recommend!"
Positive,"Chicken tikka, and mutton meals are worth trying."
Positive,"First time visiting there by chance! The reception area is good for taking Instagram pictures! Didn't have a reservation and arrived about lunch time but was greeted warmly and accommodated by the friendly staff!
While eating I noticed a pattern that is quite similar to Citrus by the pool and realized they both are the same company!
I loved the waffles and the portion of the ice cream was huge! I think the waiter gave me a different flavor instead of what I requested which I didn't even notice till my wife pointed it out! Guess I was too busy enjoying the waffle.
Their Cajun lamb chops need a slight improvement as it was a bit chewy but the flavour was good and the mashed potatoes were tasty!
For the price it's definitely worth it!
Hope to visit again soon."
Positive,Not sure why the rating quite low. Definitely  deserve higher. This is actually a hard to find very yummy old school tze char stall. Give it a try and u will know!
Negative,Look at the ridiculous patty size!!! I feedback to the staff immediately. She just smile and walked away!!??
Positive,"Very delicious food, speedy delivery, and presentation was also good considering it came via delivery.
Samsui chicken was very tasty as usual, Ginger fried rice was fragrant and delicious, brocolli was the right texture and taste, hometown tofu was simple and soothingly tasty, sweet and sour pork was abit small but nonetheless good, longevity buns were beautiful.  Super happy on the effort taken, thank you team at IMM, a very scrumptious meal indeed."
Positive,"The plain prata is among the best in town. Worth coming just for that. Mutton soup is not bad as well.
Busy but Clean at any time of the day"
Positive,Son said the kids meal - Fried chicken was very yummy! Fried squid is good too! Decent priced with a nice marina view sitting outdoors.
Positive,I was quite surprised to find this restaurant in airport terminal 3 that served pretty good quality Indian breakfast food. My friend and I really enjoyed this healthy breakfast option over other fast food options for our food before our flight. It‚Äôs self service and price is airport price but the food is definitely worth it given we pay more for dry burgers.
Positive,Sandep was the MVP for the night. Excellent service and hospitality from him. He recomended us food that is to our liking. Thankyou! Food was good and to did not disappoint. However the prawns from the pasta was not the freshest as the entire prawns was black. Steak and  Tiramisu turned out great. Will revisit again.
Positive,I always have the young mutton biryani here. It's perhaps the only authentic Hyderabadi biryani in Singapore that I will rate. The rest are all average.
Negative,"The restaurant just reopened a week ago and it‚Äôs our first time at the buffet. The place was quite quiet, buffet spread is limited but have ample seats. The bbq pork ribs was the best dish among all. The Malaysia lok lok section have quite a lot of selection but they didn‚Äôt have a good deep fryer where the food wasn‚Äôt fried enough. So some came out uncooked and very oily inside. Hot coffee and tea is included in the buffet. Dessert was not good‚Ä¶ the worst would be the kueh pie tee. The look of it won‚Äôt make you wana try as the stew vege was so dry and burnt. The cups have a bad oil taste too. But we had a good table service from Mr Azman where he keep recommending us to try different food! :)"
Positive,"Excelent plain pratas (one of the best in Singapore)
Best teh halia.
Good dum biryani (only every Friday)
Decent selections for mixed rice meals.
Good People too.

Been eating there almost daily since They started their shop in Toa Payoh interchange."
Positive,"Had a great meal at Tambi. Arrived at the restaurant on the dot and was showed to our seats. Looks pretty intimate dining at counter seats could see the chefs at work. A bit small but I believe there are bigger tables upstairs for bigger groups.
Asked the staff for recommendations and was given a few to decide. In the end since we were here we decided to order everything that was recommended.
Began with the starters, the Yellowtail Ssam which tasted interesting cooked Indian style and was complemented with the charred pineapple. Loved the pineapple which brought sweetness to the dish. The beef tartare was my most favourite in the starters which I believe should be ordered. If not the Oxtail bone marrow Murtabak should also be on the order list because it tasted so flavorful and richness of the oxtail.
Was given 2 recommendations for mains but we initially ordered one and then finally decided to get the other. First was the prawn  Maggie goreng, filled with wokhey you can see it as the chef was cooking and very fresh and giant prawn. Then we ordered and the 2nd main came which was the Australian wagyu bulgogi roti which I would say this would probably be the star of the night. So good and all the ingredients complemented each other so well the beef could just melt in the mouth.
Dessert was the banana and coconut pie which was a tad disappointing for me. Didn't really like it and would not recommend that.
Also tried a glass of Makgeolli Oh My Gat and it was quite an interesting drink.
Overall still an enjoyable meal with some memorable dishes."
Positive,"A  beautiful riverside spot in Sentosa Cove. Perfect spot to relax and unwind, featuring a Mediterranean interior.  It‚Äôs where you can enjoy delicious Mediterranean dishes with panoramic view. All their dishes are made fresh with quality ingredients and served in a warm and casually comfortable setting."
Positive,"Delicious Japanese food. Ordered a set of sashimi, bento, and a beef yuzu sauteed.

Sashimi was fresh, and almost all cuts of meat tasted rich and creamy. The swordfish was the standout fish.

The Natsu bento set came with a variety of side dishes. Tha beef yakiniku was well seasoned and well cooked, and the garlic fried rice was fragrant and not too salty.

The beef yuzu sauteed is an interesting dish to try, being served with a yuzu sorbet at the side. The beef was nicely cooked, and eaten with the yuzu sorbet creates an interesting flavour and sensation, fusing sweet, sour, and savoury, and balancing warm and cold.

Definitely coming back again for the dishes."
Positive,"Good quality Japanese food. Had the hot stone beef on a lead with home made miso paste. The beef was perfectly tender. The only problem was that even with an early reservation for a business lunch, they squeezed 7 of us into a table that was clearly for 6, and one of the tables was higher than the other two."
Positive,"Prawn is the medium size one and the noodles belong to the wetter side. Prawn and sotong quite fresh.

Not mind blowing but imo btr than the crowded geylang stalll."
Positive,Nice area to walk around. There's nearby parking that at night it's quite affordable too (I think we paid 2sgd for 2 hours). Pets are welcomed and can be seen quite often in the restaurants. Prices can be steep but the food is generally worth it
Positive,Hidden gem in Holland Village. Had the calpis sour (12) and gyudon (12). Meat was nice and had the charred taste and rice had great texture too. Ambience is very chill and quiet (Thursday 10pm) and service quality was great. Amazing experience overall and would definitely come back in the future.
Positive,"Hot Dog (SGD $20) @ Brotzeit.
.
Some may not know that Brotzeit is a Singaporean brand, opening its 1st outlet in July 2006, and since then has grown to 10 outlets in 5 countries.
.
Their German Bavarian rendition has a crisp toasted sourdough bun with bready sour earthy flavour, and a long snappy juicy k√§sekrainer pork and cheese sausage with meaty savoury spice cheesy salty flavour.
.
A light pickled gherkin relish with vegetal sour sweet flavour, creamy mayonnaise with milky sweet notes, and crispy fried shallots with vegetal earthy salty sweet flavour, complete this.
.
Sliced red chili lend an Asian twist and a mild spicy kick."
Positive,"Such luxuriously enjoyable Omakase ü§ó
Rich sea urchin melts in our mouth ü§§
With friendly staff and chef, complementing with the sweet umeshu, making the meal even more mesmerising ü§†"
Positive,"This old school restaurant brings you back to your childhood with heartwarming dishes like promfet fish, braised goose and ginkgo yam paste. Service staff were friendly and food was served piping hot and fast. Great for 3 generation meal gatherings."
Positive,Excellent place for their vege dish. Our fav dishes have always been their crispy lotus and long beans plus the long beans fried with hae bee! Today we ordered the herbal chicken and the meat was tender and juicy! Of course the lady who tooked our order is always polite and provides good service even when she has many orders at hand.
Positive,I've eaten here many times for lunch and dinner. The food here is delicious and the portion size is generous. The prices are reasonable. The service standard here is also very good. The banchan dishes are all very good.
Positive,"Hellishly hot place to have lunch, but my colleagues and I drive over every day for lunch like a ritual for 4 days out of 5. Food is really good, the basics like horfun, fried rice, fish soup etc are very well done with great portions and meat/veg. Meat dishes like salted egg chicken can be rather pricey unfortunately. $5/pax gets you more decent portions than the nearby market can. Service is good."
Negative,Shiity place briyani at $7.50 without egg nor the crispy thing.
Positive,Love the fresh yummy sashimi that are carefully put together. Love the flavours in each dish. It was so filling and yummy. A good and reasonable price omakase dinner. Would recommend.
Negative,"I am extremely disappointed with the restaurant's decision to change the price of their Paper Tosai. It has become absolutely ridiculous and unjustifiable.

As a result, I will not be returning to this establishment anymore. The inflated prices have completely tarnished my dining experience. I urge others to be cautious before dining here, as the value for money is simply not worth it."
Negative,"The food is average; the double-boiled watermelon soup is well well-created. Traditional Stir Fried Mee Sua is too oily but tastes good. The steamed flounder was a significant letdown; it is tasteless - even the soy sauce is without taste (I believe it could be they took a frozen piece of fish and started steaming, causing this to happen). The decoration is unique and well-created; however, the restaurant is like a marketplace; if you want to enjoy your dinner in peace, avoid this place. They were banging their bowls and plates just next table, which we had to bear constantly."
Positive,"we decided to try this Korean restaurant! the staff were nice and friendly, and the servings were HUGE! we had the teriyaki chicken bowl, which unfortunately did not have a lot of chicken. on the positive side, they gave a large amount of fresh lettuce with a drizzle of kewpie mayonnaise, and added some krispy treats on the side to give the meal a perfect texture! the kimchi on the side was fresh as well, and the soup was delish. the side of fried chicken was perfectly crispy and juicy too. we would definitely come back to try more food!"
Positive,"Thank you for making my first omakase experience at your restaurant so special! It was a belated birthday celebration with my best friend, and the entire afternoon was truly memorable.

The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. When I realized I couldn't eat the beef in the ""SO BBQ"" dish (the description only mentioned hanging tenderloin), they quickly offered a delicious fish alternative without any hesitation. I truly appreciate their understanding and willingness to ensure I had a wonderful dining experience. Perhaps adding small icons to the menu indicating the type of meat in each dish would be helpful for future diners, especially those with allergies or preferences. For non-Korean speakers, adding translations or clearer description could improve understanding.

The food was fantastic overall, with a variety of creative and flavourful dishes. The sauces were flavorful, but perhaps a touch too strong for some of the dishes, slightly masking the delicate taste of the main ingredient. I also absolutely loved their kombucha and hope they consider selling it in batches in the future!

Overall, I had a fantastic experience at your restaurant and would highly recommend it to others. The staff's attentiveness, the delicious food, and the unique omakase format combined for a truly memorable experience. Thank you once again!"
Positive,"The food and services was above expectation and services was fast.
My first time there and the first impression on the food taste was exceptional good and couple with good view on a jetty"
Positive,"Went to this place for buffet lunch.Its close to Tanjong Pagar MRT, exit A in Icon Village.

The north Indian styled food tasted nice (I just had veg dishes) with one veg and one non veg starter,jeera rice,daal,naan,two veg sabji (palak panner and Gobi masala) ,two non veg curry ( chicken and mutton) ,salad and sweet dish (Rasgulla). Loved the veg pakoras :)

It has a nice sitting space.
Only con I felt that,they should refill the empty dishes fast."
Negative,"This feedback is especially only for Kailash Parbat Changi and I am a regular customer at KP Little India. I visited around 8.15 PM along with my friends family for Dinner for my daughter's birthday and we were total 13 pax. First of all, as usual food was amazing except MINI NAAN BOMB(it was in expired state which was shocking and unexpected for us but we just thought like it can happen sometime).. Now reason for giving 1 star for service, the service was extremely slow and no one was bothered to check back, we were keep calling them for the orders but it was very careless response always.. When we were placing one final order around 9.10 PM, person taking order immediately said as ""no more roti's(breads)"" is possible as we are closing now. Why I am surprised is because she didn't even listen as what I am about to order so it was very bad experience and I believe Kailash Parbat at Changi is good only for Buffets and not for Ala Carte as staff are very lazy and bit rude.. One last thing is our bill was 250+ so we were been informed that we can go for some complimentary or discount of 5% on bill but we were done with our food so we opted for discount which was not applied during payment and when I called & checked back with restaurant, response is that its customer's responsibility to inform during payment at counter as we cannot check with each customer during payment, its funny again as response was bit hard to listen. So guys plan accordingly at this outlet specifically  when planning for Ala Carte so that you don't get face disappointment."
Positive,"One of my favourite restaurant in Woodlands

Ordered
Mushroom soup
Squid Ink pasta
Sirloin steak
Escargot
Chocolate Lava cake

The squid ink pasta is all time favourite
Sirloin steak only has option for well done and medium. Tried the medium and the doneness just nice
The hot chocolate lava goes well with ice cream

Price is affordable and dishes taste good"
Negative,"Food was good
Rice were a little too tough
Surcharges on 5th day of Chinese lunar new year
2employees were talking to each other across our table over why one sat and took our order at that table in Cantonese.
Felt that they lack of respect for customers."
Positive,"Teh Halia is excellent. Good balance of ginger jus and teh. A little frothy would have completed the experience. 5*

Fritter was cold. Decent in taste but I reckon it would be excellent if it was at least warm. 4*

Maggi Mee Goreng was flavorful and came with 2 small pieces of fried chicken which were average. 3.5*

Kway Teow Kuah was very much a disaster. Kway Teow was not blanched through resulting it stiffed. The kuah was good. With only a few strands of cabbage and an egg, there was nothing else. No bits of protein nor pea. Come on, for the price! 2*

Service is prompt. Upon ordering from server, the food will be served to your table."
Positive,"Best dining experience I had in Singapore and I live here for over 10 years. Relaxed atmosphere, wine pairing is only an option (not a must!), food is absolutely delicious, great fusion of best quality meats and seafood. Strong flavors which paired so well, unbelievable. I am European so I do pay attention to my sourdough, I haven‚Äôt tried something like this in my life. These are really passionate people cooking in front of you; just watch, enjoy, relax and admire!"
Positive,The Hainan pork chop is good. The rest of the dish is decent very average taste. Today with only 2 of us. we order a fish which is quite big and they recommended us to try pork knuckle with sea cucumber which is huge. There is no way 2 person can finish the pork knuckle let along we have other dish. There is 2 small piece of sea cucumbers in there to show.
Positive,"The service was excellent and the food was very tasty too. We ordered the recommended dishes and they were all well executed. To top it all, the dishes were great value for money too. We‚Äôll definitely be back for more."
Positive,"First time dining here since they moved.  Staff are friendly enough, and the restaurant serves several sets for lunch, including Thai chicken with rice, and fried pork with rice.  There are also ala carte dishes like sambal kang kong and sotong, as well as otah.

Our Thai chicken and fried pork sets were okay, and the sunny side up eggs were freshly cooked and delish.  The rice was a large portion, but the meat was not.  We also ordered an ice lemon tea and lime juice.  Lunch overall was $19.90, which was slightly on the high side."
Positive,"Love the ambience, service and food here. The enchanting entrance will sure catch your attention while you walk past it! Staff was really friendly and attentive.

Highly recommend the Sea Urchin rolled with Kagoshima A4 Wagyu Beef, Beluga Caviar."
Positive,"Portion of main was big. Ordered the Hawaiian teriyaki chicken chop. The marinade was abit on the sweet side, and too sweet for me.

Ordered a main and their promotion of a dozen of $1 oysters. Was a steal!

Was a hearty meal. Good enough for 2 ladies to share."
Positive,"Great Japanese restaurant.
Service was good. The staff was polite and was prompt to guide us to our seats.
Food was priced reasonable.
Quite like the food here and was a great dining experience.
A bright and clean environment to enjoy a wonderful meal.

The only issue to me was the wasabi wasn‚Äôt easily available. I had to wait the the bowl of wasabi to go one round of the conveyor belt."
Positive,Had prosperity lunch (CNY promotional menu) here. Food is good and service is prompt.
Positive,"Been to Charlie's Restaurant on a weekend afternoon at Boat Quay to have lunch recently. Got a seat along the Singapore River and the view was perfect to enjoy on a breezy afternoon. Ordered the Charlie's burger which was one of their signature item on the menu, it was great! A whiff of it got my mouth watering.. The quality of the ingredients and texture of the meat are spectacular, patty was juicy which I personally enjoy very much. Service staffs were also friendly, ensured that guests are well taken care of at the restaurant. Definitely worth a return to try other food on their menu!"
Positive,"Nice place to have brewed beer. Until 3pm the beer cost is 3 Sgd fir one pint value for money
Must try items is INDIAN PALE ALE and I recommend GOLDEN WHEAT BEER . Best way to spend Sunday with friends ."
Negative,"Went for the buffet on a weekday evening.

This is our 3rd time eating. And each time the food standard has changed and dropped. Now for 45++ for dinner, it is quite a steep price. But u do get a good variety of food. Some hits some misses.

The abacus used to be awesome, but the last 2 visits were disappointing. The roast and bbq pork was good, standards maintained. Drunken prawns  good too. Chilli crab, lacked flavour but the crab quality was solid n meaty. Buddha jump over the wall was decent, with an abalone, black chicken, mushroom some cordecyp flowers and a tiny dried scallop. The kailan was quite salty. Spinach 3 egg was average. Orh nee dessert good altho i didn't fancy the coconut cream. Mango sago normal.

Staff was friendly and thoughtful. But then again we were the ONLY table that evening.

The buffet is a good option to try various options. Portions are standard zichar sizes and not small plates so if u go eat in a small group, you may not be able to try many dishes cos you'll be full early on."
Positive,One of my family's favorite eating place. We have always enjoyed the food and it can have an extra serving of the soup. Yummy and comfort food
Positive,"We tried signature dishes, Èªë‰∏âÂâÅ, Seafood Paofan and it‚Äôs was flavourful üëçüëç We also tried their suan cai yu and the fish is fresh tasting, tender yet firm. Staff was friendly"
Negative,"Yuzu was the highlight of the food and beverages served here. The location is pretty inaccessible unless by car. Grill, finger food and hotpot options. Not many tables available."
Positive,"Came here on July 18th, 2023. Located at the other end of Zhongshan Mall, near Ramada Hotel (currently closed) and facing Zhongshan Park. Quite a cool place with comfortable seating. Had the Paneer Salad, Mutton Vindaloo and Naan bread, all of which were really tasty and accompanied my beers very well. I was only surprised to hear English music when I walked in as I was hoping for some Indian tunes, only later to realize that they mix the playlist with English and Tamil songs. Nevertheless, service was great also."
Negative,Don‚Äôt waste your money and time here. I tried it once and will never come back here. The food is not cheap either.
Positive,"My favorite dish here is the Basil Chicken Rice. Hands down the best I‚Äôve had in Singapore.

The Thai style Kang Kong was kinda weird. It tastes like vegetables cooked in curry sauce."
Negative,"Mixed Experience (Visit Date 26 Jun 22)

It was great that:
1.Not crowded when we went at 6pm and got a cosy corner seat
2. Friendly servers
3. Casual environment
4. The food came fast
5. Quesadilla, Samosa, Aglio Olio were good

Disappointing:
1. Ordered sweet potato fries.  Got us  regular fries. They took it back. A gentleman came back to say they didn't have sweet potato. So we asked to give us regular ones. Then someone got us some soggy ones. The same ones they made by mistake for us earlier?
2. The lady seemed to get things a little mixed up. Messed up the fries and then just forgot we had ordered quesadillas.
3. Prices (of drinks that we got) at par or more than FOC Sentosa or Coastes. View, Ambience and Service do not match"
Positive,"Great food with friendly crews!!!! The lighting in d restaurant is something new to me. They have both bright and romantic(cosy ) dining areas for us to choose
.. Food with reasonably pricing... The nice to meet u platter is cool"
Positive,"Convenient location. Food and service are average, but too expensive."
Positive,Good variety of dim sum.
Positive,Food was a littleeee salty like those you would find in Bangkok but nothing to really complain about. Just ask for less salty if you prefer it that way. The service was impeccable! They were more than happy to answer our questions and were very friendly.
Positive,"Very prompt service, comfortable place for both casual or formal tasty meals. Samsui Chicken with ginger sauce & lettuce is always so refreshing. Staff were very pleasant too!"
Positive,Music is a bit loud but food is good.
Positive,"My private family‚Äôs lunch at this Michelin star restaurant was exceptional. The chef's creativity shone through in the dishes, which were full of flavor and presented beautifully. The service was attentive and professional, making the dining experience even more enjoyable. The atmosphere was private and stylish, with pleasant decorations and a perfect setting for dining. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys fine dining.$$$$"
Positive,"Samurai chicken burger was nice especially the sauce! The green tea ice cream was okay only, it's not matcha, but green tea. The seaweed fries were very flavourful too."
Negative,"Ordered veg and got non-veg. Tried calling almost a dozen times and then drove back all the way to the restaurant, instead of accepting the mistake, they were arguing but finally accepted the mistake and replaced with the veg dish. Overall quality of food has dramatically gone down. Overall very poor experience - both with the food and with how we were dealt with. Used to be our regular haunt for good north Indian food but don't think we will go there again."
Positive,"The quality of the food we had, particularly the pork, was absolutely exceptional. The succulent and flavorful taste of the grilled meat left us craving for more. It was evident that great care had been taken in sourcing high-quality ingredients and ensuring their preparation was done with expertise. The combination of flavors and the overall taste surpassed our expectations. Thank you!"
Positive,"Argentinian Steakhouse, Charcoal Grilled Dry-Aged Steaks!

Restaurant Manager, Emil is very friendly and hospitable. Their staffs asked whether we need glasses for our Whiskies and offered to wash our Glasses when we are done.

They allow us to Bring Whisky Bottle and it‚Äôs CORKAGE FREE!"
Negative,"Kaisendon options are good value and tasty. They also served a free bowl of miso soup, appetiser (carrot, daikon, and some bits of fish), and cold tea, which is nice. Unfortunately, the beef tataki was quite disappointing. It had a texture that was somewhat off and didn't quite taste like beef. No sear and was cooked more done than it should be. It might be that we were unlucky and got a bad piece because we saw others which looked much better."
Positive,My daughter is obsessed with their pratas. It is our go to joint. Staff are super warm and friendly. Great and fast service.
Positive,Visited a few times with my friends already. Food is really good and serves fast. The manager here gives good recommendations too! Recommend to visit!
