"I had a fantastic experience at this restaurant! The food was absolutely superb, and the service was top-notch. During my visit for lunch, I had the pleasure of trying both the chili and pepper crab dishes. The crab meat was incredibly fresh, and the dark pepper sauce was a standout‚Äîit paired perfectly with the crab. To end on a sweet note, I indulged in the mango coconut dessert, which was not only beautifully presented but also impressively layered. I highly recommend this place for an unforgettable dining experience!"
"had an amazing experience there, with service from the staff being exceptional. came in for the last hour of the restaurant and was given complimentary drinks as well. had our food packed nicely as we could not finsih them in time. overall great experience with a great atmosphere!"
"The uncle serving the satay here was EXTREMELY RUDE to us. Don‚Äôt bother going here. He was grumbling so much throughout the entire time we were ordering. If you don‚Äôt know how to serve your customers nicely, just close your shop."
The food is different from what picture looks like. No vege at all despite all the green in their picture. Not much ingredients and definitely does not worth the price.
"We got a voucher after dining in at Galangal Bishan (their ‚Äùsister‚Äù outlet), came to try their milkshake & cake. Very generous portion for milkshake. The menu stated ‚Äúmini milkshake‚Äù but it came out to be giant hahaha! Love the service, very attentive. Will come back to try their food another day!

Chocolate crunch cake MUST TRY  - very crunchy not too sweet.

Ambience: very cozy setting.there are outdoor seating as well feels like outdoor camping."
"Ordered BBQ grilled prawns, disappointed üëé taste like light fry with salt! did not have any grilled!  $16 not worthy. Maybe they are too busy, have too many other orders!!  Not recommended!"
Nice Dishes and Bbq Fish
"Had a meal here on Mother's day. Food was promptly served. Samsui chicken is a must-order dish. Soup of the day (lotus root) and olive rice tasted pretty good to me as well. Tapioca leaves dish was mediocre.

Do note that olive rice is steamed rice and not olive fried rice, so flavours are definitely lighter than what you should expect from fried rice. I liked it though, as it didn't overpower the other dishes we had."
Awesome dining experience! I rarely leave reviews but Sol & Ora was so good I think it deserves a shoutout. Tried the 4-course dinner set menu during restaurant week. Food was great with generous portions. Service was tiptop! Thanks to Nikolas and Khalisa for your attentiveness and great service. Great vibes all round. Definitely coming back again!
"Our first time KFC at Singapore. Tasty fried chicken, serve really well. Very helpful and friendly staff."
"One of the best katsu in Singapore! Go for the loin if you prefer something fatty, but opt for the fillet if you want a leaner cut. Both curry options and ‚Äúplain‚Äù were amazing. It‚Äôs packed even on a Monday night. Worth a visit."
"Nice chill vibes as can see a few horses at a near distance if there are trainings going on. The garlic clams with broth and garlic bread, fish & chips and angel hair pasta with seafood are good!
P.S. staff are polite and friendly too"
"The spinach tofu is very delicious, there‚Äôs mushrooms, and gravy with some scallops bits..there‚Äôs like egg in side the Toufu...üëçüèªüëçüèª"
"Food is tasty. A bit pricy but food portion is good for 2pax. Place is comfy, clean and nice for intimate dinner dates. üòÖ Good music also.
Manager and staffs are polite üëçüèª"
"Teppei offers a great Japanese Omakase dinner experience. The place feels like a Japanese Izakaya with the bar seats at the counter. While it may seem cramped, it is also very homely. The dinner menu changes on a monthly basis.

The October 2023 was a tie up with Nagasaki prefecture. The food is good as always.

The prices have gone up slightly since I first ate here many years ago. But the service hasn‚Äôt changed much."
"Ramen lunch set is costly priced:) 11.9++
Ramen, side dish, drink"
"Food here overall more at a salty side but is good if you are prefer heavy tasted food.

Paper wrapped chicken is nowadays difficult to find which is why recommended but the saltiest dish. Be prepared if you would like to try. The meat is really tender though

Environment is the old school chinese restaurant style. Building is abit old as well but clean (toilet is clean)."
"I usually eat at this restaurant mostly night times around 2 or 3 am. This time when I arrive around 2am the Chinese lady came out and said they packed already and closed which is obviously she don‚Äôt wanna accept me and my friend so I asked isn‚Äôt close at 4am and she said no, we packed and close now. I was so mad didn‚Äôt say anything to her and I just left. Won‚Äôt come again since I feel like her attitude was bad. Thanks ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"This restaurant does not even deserved to be called ""a restaurant"" and it deserved zero star! ""Hongkong"" milk tea is actually kopitiam teh bing. Servings all super small. Deep fried prawn dumpling is filled with oil and spurt out when biting. Egg tarts are super mini. None of what I ordered satisfy me. I think kopitiam dim sum taste even nicer. Staffs super attitude. I will not come again. Please close shop ASAP, you don't deserve to be in our World No. 1 airport. They called themselves ""Famous""... For those who think their food is nice, please go and try Red Star Restaurant at Chin Swee Rd."
"The food is good, but the staff not recommend the right way for customers, if someone order an item for one person only, they not mention to the customers regarding the portion is very big, just want customers to spend more money only"
"My wife and I were looking for a nice restaurant near the Clan Hotel.   It was raining hard and Mazzo was only a few minutes walk.   We ordered a pizza, grilled fish combo and tiramisu.   All were excellent.   The prices were good for Singapore and the Manager James was very friendly."
"Walked passed this a few times during lunch and finally decided to try it with a group of friends. I really like the fusion taste and unique presentation, especially the trendy Peking duck, apple wood chicken and grand duke jiang‚Äôs carch. Definitely not your typical Sichuan food, and worth a try."
"It was rather crowded on a weekday evening. We went to this restaurant not knowing that it is a vegan restaurant üòÇ food was ok and the servers were all friendly, just that they reek of smoke smell. Prices above average. Many tourists and non-local there."
"First time try. We enjoyed the food, service and ambience. Price was also reasonable. The photos show two of the dishes that we liked. The other dishes were delicious too such as the Peking Duck and the Scallion Sakura Chicken."
"Food is really good! They are well known for thai, western & indian food. We got the pad thai & 300g ribeye - no regrets at all!

The live band, made up of the twins & a wonderful guitarist, was really good as well! Will definitely revisit üòä"
"We always end our golfing day at this restaurant. Very high ceiling, spacious indoor seating. Outdoor seating overlooks at 9th and 18th hole with beautiful waterfront scenery and good place to catch the plane going to landings though it can get really noisy. If you are sitting outdoor, be sure to sit on the right side as the sofa seats on the left side might at times get hit by golf balls, though rather rare. Food and service are fantastic. They serve local, japanese, western food and all taste great! I had the laksa and was pretty good! The hotdog is huge, bigger than my face. Beef hor fun was ok, would give that a miss. Sushi is definitely a go for."
"I tried it for the first time with a friend.  I like how cozy the place is and the food is really good, I like the crispiness of the salmon and the quantity is huge for the chicken cutlet with melted cheese. It was delicious, my friend was so in awe that I found this place as it was located in a quite deserted area. The vanilla latte is quite nice too.
Will definitely come back to enjoy this."
"A cozy cafe with very friendly staff who make the effort to get to know you. The cold brew is good and so is the coffee jelly that‚Äôs specially made by the lady boss who had stayed in Japan for 10 years.
Weekday lunches may have rice bowls which are really yummy.
On weekend evenings, this place is transformed and turned into cozy bar that serves classic cocktails. Follow them on Instagram for updates."
Still one of the very exceptional Zi char stalls around if you got the patience of 45 mins.
"I would say the food isnt authentic Korean as its tagline. Taste was ok, Bulgogi beef was charred at the bottom. Bibimbap was good, Ramyeon was ok.

Good views from the restaurant"
Fried rice was decent but could use more wokhey. But no idea why it was not hot when I ate there. The mapo dofu on the other hand was great and piping hot.
"Drinks are unique. Love their bar bites. Price is ok.

Great to unwind after a long day and see the planes land.

Service is good.  Would return again."
Ordered prawn kway teow dry with chilli. They added black soya sauce into the dish which makes it a bit sweet. The chilli is spicy. The soup is thick and flavourful. The pork slices are a bit hard and not tender. It would be better if they remove the black soya sauce.
"We like the service of Kay.very polite and helpful.
Gd service.
We like her very much"
"<√∂+ TasteMarked Reviews +√∏>
Experience not very good. I came here during lunch hour with colleagues. Food tasted very plain, shrimp not fresh, steam fish over cooked, soup over-powered by Chinese cooking wine taste. Most important of all - serving speed is extremely slow (we are just one of the 3 tables), and both our table and the table next to us are constantly asking them to speed up. We spent most of the time just waiting. Absolutely not suitable for business lunch.
What I like:
- plenty of parking lots
- air conditioned
What can be improved:
- food taste need to be greatly improved
- serving frustratingly slow"
Very friendly and nice food definitely recommend
"Service quality very good. The indian staff at the counter super friendly and good manners. The food is terrible. Super sweet, the fries were cold soggy. Terrible terrible terrible. New place so I guess standard not there. First and last time trying this place. Not suitable for vegetarian. Low quality food too. Shake was really thick but quality not there for the price paid."
"Today is Deepavali, so not crowded at all. The mutton biriyani is very tasty and not all all spicy. The mutton melts perfectly in your mouth. The chicken corma and garlic naan is a great pair. I can tastes the richness in the corma.

Overall great food. Staff are friendly and welcoming."
"Pretty good Indian food, not cheap but not too expensive. Good place for folks living in bayshore area, it's with the condo but open to public."
"A dinner treat from my cousin on 17 Feb. We had the $888++ dinner menu for 10pax.

1st dish: CNY Yusheng with Tiny Baby Abalones
Comments: Looks delicious but I didn‚Äôt eat it. My children enjoyed it.

2nd dish: Braised Shark‚Äôs Fin Soup
Comments: Tasted salty but flavourful.

3rd dish: Braised Vegetables with Baby Abalones
Comments: Nicest amongst all

4th dish: Roast chicken with crackers
Comments: Common and standard roast chicken

5th dish: Steamed Sea-bass with Garlic
Comments: Fish meat not that tender and the taste of garlic was over powering.

6th dish: Steamed Prawns with Garlic
Comments: Nice and generous portion

7th dish: Fried Ee-fu Noodles with Enoki Mushrooms and Bamboo Shoots
Comments: Wok Hey taste and texture good

8th dish: Creamy Mango Sago with Peach Gum
Comments: Looks unpleasant and not appetising due to its colour and it tasted too sweet.

Overall, I think their customer service was better than their dishes. üòÅ"
"One of the regular Zi char stalls that I patronise. Salted pork ribs is a must try!

$34nett meal cost:
- Salted Egg pork ribs $14
- Seafood Hor Fan (medium) $8
- Triple Egg Spinach $12

You can take bus 238 from Toa Payoh Mrt & alight at the 5th stop at blk 23. Yi jia is located at the blk infront. Walkable distance.

There's a toilet right next to the stall too."
"The service was outstanding, the staff were very friendly, professional and immaculate. The highlight was the pizza, this was like it was made in Napoli and the ambience was just perfect. The dough and toppings were made from the finest ingredients, better than any pizza I have had in Australia and better than I have had in Lake Como. The carpaccio fish (sashimi) was delicate and delicious. The smaller steak size which we ordered wasn‚Äôt on the menu but we couldn‚Äôt eat such a large serve that was offered and they accommodated to our needs. The steak was seasoned perfectly and cooked medium rare also to perfection. I can‚Äôt speak more highly of this restaurant that is at Capella. We wanted to dine at a very nice restaurant this evening and even looked at what Michelin star restaurants were around, but this place an excellent choice and the wine we choose was a Pinot noir which complimented our dining experience.10/10 compliments to the chef Antonio."
"Staff very nice to remaid the waiting time,
After 8PM need wait 20 minutes.
But the KFC apps very stupid, the apps price expensive then shop, also never remind food need wait and closing time."
We love Blossom at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore! We came back the next day to try the dim sums during lunch and absolutely loved every single dish. The service is simply perfect; we kept getting our tea refilled throughout our meal‚Ä¶Thank you! We will be back when we visit Singapore.
"Food is super good, flavour on point. Tandoori chicken was so fresh and tender. MASALA TEA MUST TRY!!!! üëç"
"Very limited selection.
Overall it‚Äôs good enough to satisfy dim sum cravings.

Generally airport food/restaurants are bad.

No comments. Will I return. Likely not. Going to try other bad restaurants in the airport."
"Ambience was great with a smaller crowd when we arrived 8pm+ on a Saturday. Staff were interactive and fun to converse with. Food was also great, and the mashed potatoes with the wagyu steak sealed the deal for me."
"Takeaway big breakfast meal with corn options.
But no spoon, no butter for corn?
Inside big breakfast don't have hashbrown also."
"I rarely have a ""fancy"" lunch but on a friends recommendation (she also hasn't been), we decided to give it a try. Great first impressions upon entering the restaurant- very agreeable interior design and furnishings and a very warm welcome was extended. The menu was indeed interesting with 2, 3 and course options priced very reasonably at $45, $55 and $65. The selection was not extensive but very well curated with sufficient choices to whet one's appetite. There are surcharges for more premium selections but we found them very worthwhile and value for money. 4 of us ordered various combinations and every dish from starters to desserts were impressive from plating presentation to taste. In short  a great restaurant with a well curated menu, very well executed dishes (sauces for all mains and starters were uniquely different), great elegant ambience and certainly value for money. I would return to dine here for sure. The Chef definitely knows what he is doing and the service crew was great ..attentive, responsive and knowledgeable.  We need more restaurants of this calibre and price point. GREAT job guys !!!!"
Food tastes authentic and service was quick. They noticed that we were not comfortable outside because of the smoke and offered to move us in with all our food.
"First time and loved the vibe. The food was generally good. In particular the sides. The scallops, prawn sushi roll and grilled octopus. The pork was a tad tough but the taste of the meats were good. Will come back again!"
"The only restaurant that I know; offers cold or warm water the moment you sit down. Instead of charging for water like the majority of restaurant.
Second reason, they hire special needs staff. Awesome!
3rd is affordability and serving good ice cream. Kudos Swensen's üòÄ"
Today we have visit blk 801 alsalam restaurant. We have order one Masala dosa and sambar (veg) . Halfway we saw he put inside the sambar mutton piece. I show them. But they haven't give answer. They have don't care.   I am vegetarian.  I have very bad experience with this restaurant. Next time I don't want to visit there. I request everybody be careful.
"Just don't order the food from them in panda. Food is totally cold when arrive and uneatable, have to throw away. Total waste of money."
"Pizza hut Macpherson  is cooling  place, order a pizza waiting  time verry fast. Pizza served  was hot and fresh. Staff friendly. Will visit  again."
It‚Äôs a laid-back neighborhood pub. Owner is a nice gentleman who is really friendly. Nice place for a quiet drink or two with a few friends.
"Although Michelin 1 star title cannot be extraordinary because Singapore is one of the famous countries regarding gourmet, it is definitely sure that Labyrinth is so special because it only focuses on Singaporean cuisine.

Each menu including detailed explanation with distinctive story about Singapore culture and ingredients was impressive, and the best point is they succeeded in catching the taste.
(Lots of restaurants are missing)

I highly recommend this place if you want to experience something special available only in Singapore with low pressure to try unusual food.

This restaurant has a nice selection of pairings."
"We had dinner here during peak dinner hour on Saturday. Very crowded, we queued about 20-30 mins. The beehoon was good, the best among all other dishes we ordered, the fried rice was a little bit too spicy for my uncle; but it was ok for me. Rest of other dishes were decent and above average. We will love to come back to try out more food here."
"Worth visiting, I was there about 5:30pm. No queue but the place already packed. The service was great, friendly & helpful! Food was delicious & portions are quite big. No for dates, as the seating is a bit squeeze to accommodate more diners. Wide variety of food available."
"Nice, clean and comfortable.  Aircon.   Updated with the new menu here that I venture over to look for lormee but their zichar chef have left.  Everyday cooked menu is different, today is longtong and mee siam.  So I tried long tong. Clean taste. Not super salty gao type. I would say they are managing nicely. Crowd is ok.  A few regulars chatting and having tea and bread as breakfast.  The 2 ladies are nice and polite (for the people who are very crazy about services. ) Plates are served and collected by them. Next time i would try the bread for a change. The price are reasonable too.  Come here for a light meal or dish of the day. :)   Why 4 stars? The variety is limited but this place is clean and well maintained. It‚Äôs not some place that you want to seek fancy western dishes here.  The strange wu Xiang dishes have replaced the Kuehs (Chinese pastry)."
"The drink stall lady is very lovely!
Went there a few times after work to get a drink and the lady selling the drinks is always smiling and makes your drinks really fast!
Has a variety of snacks as well!"
"Visited this restaurant a month back on a Sunday evening with a party of 4. I ordered 3 dishes  - steamed pork belly (Ê¢ÖËèúÊâ£ËÇâ), steamed sea bass, a vegetable plus soup . The vegetable and soup were great but when it came to the steamed pork belly, we were shocked to find out that the inside of the dish was frozen! Which means the dish wasn't prepared to order. They must have cooked it on another occasion, kept in the freezer, and steamed it again before serving. When we informed the server, she hurriedly told the lady boss who replied it's ok - we can steam it again?!? When the sea bass was served, we also noted that almost a third of the flesh on one side of the fish was missing. As I had a guest with me, I didn't want to kick up a fuss. There were obviously a lot of other repeat customers in the restaurant as they know the lady boss personally. So I can't understand why we had such a disappointing experience on our first visit."
Bought mutton bryiani was shocked to see only just bone and tendon theres literally no meat. What kind of sick joke is this very poor
"Nice atmosphere, great lighting and set up. They served bread with olive oil. olive oil was served in a small dish that has a design of balsamic vinegar at the bottom, what a let down when I tried so hard to get the vinegar but it's not there!

Chicken paella - tasted better than it looks. Looks a little overdone and burnt. The staff squeezed the lemon for us with his bare hands, who knows if he had washed his hands before. And then he stirred the paella for us so vigorously some ingredients flew out onto the table.

Seafood tapas - portion was generous.

Omellete tapas - yummy.

Lastly, very rude manager who came over and told us to repeat our order of drinks (even when we said we JUST ordered from another service staff) -  he said ""oh he tends to forget so just tell me what you ordered"".
What kind of team spirit, culture and management is this when you are condescending towards your colleagues."
"Restaurant closes at 9.30pm, we arrived at a 9.30pm, they entertained us,  did not turn us away,  no pressure to finish our food. We left around 10am.
Staffs were pleasant and attwntive."
"This is a hole in wall place that serves delicious Thai food.

It‚Äôs very clean. They have the air-conditioned section and the non air con area. Despite that, it‚Äôs very airy with lots of circulation due to the fans installed.

We always ordered Thai Steam fish and prawn cake. These two are a lovely combination."
"Tasty food and the place is really crowded, recommend you to pre-book in advance and dishes that are signature. Food gets sold out really fast! Recommend the soup and you might want to skip the desserts."
"absolute disappointing staff service and dining experience.
my phone battery was left with less than 10% and i asked if i could charge my phone. (let's be honest in this century you can't do anything without a phone) the staff and manager told me charging phone for a customer is not allowed.

i replied ""how am i supposed to leave this place and book a grab without a phone? and i don't carry wallet, i use apple pay. with no phone i can't pay for your ramen here""

they then replied ""then u can pay now beforehand""

lol absolutely unbelievable, extremely appalled by their response. never coming back here again."
"Had lunch here a few weeks ago on a Sunday. Ordered two prawns, fried rice, sweet and sour pork etc. They are very fast and flavorful. Surprise hidden gem in fact. And it‚Äôs not too pricey for the quality. Service prompt too. Will return again.

Went to east treasure again (7 months later) after they moved to Toa payoh - full house on a Sunday. Once again very very good food - tasty good quality food. Very good quality control. Service again very good."
"It has been awhile since i had pepper lunch. The food is really nice and smells great. The service is good and food is served to us once it is ready. There is no service charge. GST is already included in the price.

The price range is higher compared to their stalls at food courts. The restaurant is spacious and there is safe distance between customers."
"Food was tasty, well balanced flavour, just about right amount of spice and numbing effect. Service was good and will come back again."
"Looking for a place to hangout and not so crowded. Randomly chanced upon this on google map and there i went.
Serves a great variety of korean food, including sliced noodle, korean dumpling soup, chilli hotplate chicken with cheese.
An authentic rare find for a kpop style cafe filled with female kpop singer music.

I presume i can visit a few more times just to try all the good food.
The korean dumpling soup is delicious, with smooth and tasty dumplings, filled with meat and rice vermicelli.
The hotplate chilli chicken is lacking compared to chuncheon dakgalbi, but still tender and filling for us.
The 3x chilli tofu stew is my friend's personal favorite, but its too spicy for me. Definitely packed a punch.

The bad thing about this place is that the air-conditioning is bad, and we are sweating profusely with hot and spicy food.
Plus, the side dishes are lacking, only got 3 type although unlimited refill of kimchi.
But the service from the staff is not bad, prompt and friendly.
Good to try again."
"Went on Sunday(17/4) evening.
Alot of dishes was sold out by 7pm..
For dim sum sold out by 7 pm its still understandable.

But no congee, no char shu, no roasted pork, no roasted chicken. This is bad.

Super shorthanded, very difficult to get servers attention."
"Nice cosy restaurant that is suitable for parties too. Location is opposite the Bukit Batok Swimming complex. Food is good, portions are decent. Do make reservations before coming down. It's run by students from Shatec. We had a birthday cake and they took the effort to put the candles and the birthday signs for us. There was a robot server that also helped to sing the happy birthday song. We had the braised beef cheek, the pan seared salmon, the striploin steak, and it also has 2 free kids meal for every 2 paying adults who order from the set meals. It's basically a 3 course dinner. They have bread and soup of the day. I especially liked the sorbet which was very refreshing! I thought its very well worth it for the price point and a good way to support our local culinary institute students to gain more experience in their line of work. Great job!"
"This is our 2nd time heading here. The food and service is fantastic. They staff take care of of your needs and recommends the daily specials and if you have any dietary restrictions. Because we were given excellent service and served fantabulous food, we are here again for the 2nd time. We were served by Ms. Eebii, again. And she greeted us ever so pleasantly and took care of us during each course we had. Will definitely be back again."
"exceptional great service I would say . special thanks to Kwai, Pauline , Chloe and I couldn‚Äôt remember the name of the lady who was serving us , sorry my bad üò•  She was the most brightest with her beautiful smile .  Overall , a wonderful Sunday Brunch . Thank you for making my pre bday brunch a memorable one ."
"Picked up dinner here tonight. Curry fish head (nonya style) is the highlight. Very spicy though. Othe dishes were tofu, prawn roll, Marmite Pork ribs and spinach with 3 type of eggs. All good."
"Food: Ordered the ice cream nuggets, banana split, and fondue.
Service: Friendly
Atmosphere: The restaurant will be crowded during peak hours."
Paying almost $10 for a dish and I can barely count the meat pieces and the onions are not even cut properly. Quality has gone down.
One of the best Nasi Rawon. The satay also nice. But satay start late afternoon.
The gluten free restaurant is a gemstone find especially for people with gluten intolerance. The food/dessert was yummy and glutenfree bread tasted like normal bread which is a rare find. Thank you for providing such delicious food suits for people with dietary requirements.
"Great dining experience for CNY reunion dinner! Dishes are hot and delicious, and value for money

Feedback: Instead of giving pineapple tarts in place of dessert, pls consider serving Chinese dessert next time"
"Very regular so-so Korean food. Though it's located in a hawker center, but price a little higher than hawker price. Ordered their Pork belly BBQ set, the Lettuce, garlic which I presume eaten as raw wraps were put together with the Enoki mushrooms, wouldn't that be cross contamination? And the plate that were in used for the BBQ is concave to collect the oil, but there's no outlet to drain the oil so the oil will splatter everywhere."
"Greeted by the sight of hair nestled in the batter as I peeled open a piece of chicken. I know my doctor suggested I eat more fiber, but I didn't know he told KFC too!"
"Was very very dissappointed as in their website lunch were a lot of different variety of foods but when we got there as you can see in the photos that was all that was worth eating for $171.60..(3 pax)
Drove all the way from tebans to eat rojak diy and sweets and fried rice,prawns and mussels,salmon.apart from that staff were great and friendly.Not that i wont reccomend it its just not really worth the money and their menu is on rotation."
Our fish was raw. We explained this to the service staff but they did not care. I would not eat or drink here it is a health hazard.
"Spot on service with an even greater hit on their food. Small menu, but wow does it show quality. Kurobuta Ragu Tagliatelle was just done to perfection. Al dente tagliatelle with a rich egginess to it paired with their ragu boasting kurobuta pork which adds depth to the whole dish and the natural sweetness of the pork made everything perfect. Their tiramisu was also spot on, creme was smooth and not too light or heavy and the lady finger was just right, not too soggy.

Simply amazing that was."
"I tried Hokkaido Sushi a couple of nights ago, and I have to say that it was an enjoyable experience!

Though the buffet spread is not vast, it‚Äôs diverse enough to be quite satisfactory. Some notable dishes that I tried were the wagyu beef cubes, grilled salmon head, and torched miso garlic swordfish nigiri. The QR code ordering system is intuitive, and food comes out quickly after each order."
"Nice family kopitiam setting. Non aircon but today's weather was so cold, hence it was a pleasant dining experience. Food was yummy. Pricing was on a average side, fish was expensive though and took a while to be served.  Service is reasonable. Overall, recommended!"
"Honestly I haven‚Äôt dined here in 3-4 years but I finally went back and it‚Äôs AMAZING! Expect fast service yet DELICIOUS food!
ü•µüå∂Ô∏è
We really loved the extra spicy sambal fried rice and hotplate tofu. The chicken Tom yum soup was generous, but the taste is alright.
üç≤
Also liked that it‚Äôs well ventilated and clean.

Overall, it‚Äôs a good place to be. Will be back again for sure"
"visited t1 yesterday and our biriyani gravy was spoilt.
my 3 kids were eating the spoilt curry as their meals came first.
I told the service crew about the spoilt gravy he just said ok and continued his job. super poor service.
my total bill was $105 for 2 biriyani, 3 masala dosa, 2 iddly, vege fried rice and 6 can drinks.
over pricing. I will report to NEA today."
"As we walked around the building thinking about what to eat after learning that our initial plan of having Mookata buffet was smashed due to that the shop was closed for a short period of time, we decided on an alternative Mookata Buffet at Cheese Story.

Before the pandemic, diners can help themselves with the free flow of food items from the designated collection point. Diners have to fill up the form on their preferred order.

The server set up the Mookata stove with few big pieces of pork lard in the middle of the pot surrounded by a pool of stock and a small tray of cheese by the side.

Let's wait for the pot to get hot and the lard to be melted so as to oil the pot.

Besides having meat, we do order some vegetables, quail eggs and vermicelli items.

Here are some more of our orders with cheese tofu, fish cake, hotdog, dumplings, luncheon meat etc.

Do not worry about the shells if you are ordering the crayfish as the server on duty will help us to deshell.

One of the consolations is that the service includes deshell of the crayfish which we find quite comfortable. The staff on duty will do it on the spot in front of us with a pair of gloves.

Other than that, the free flow of oysters. The oysters are plump and they are generous with the servings.

Other than Oysters, abalone, prawns, and crayfish. We have ordered bamboo clams, scallops, Lala, sotong (Squid) and deshelled prawns that were marinated with garlic chilli.

Here's our second round of meat, They are marinated with black pepper and garlic.

Let's dig in! The chilli they provided is not too bad but I prefer to dip most of my food into the cheese tray.

The shredded cheese was left at the side tray of the Mookata pot to melt with Nachos cheese. For the price of $29.90 Nett for Buffet style of Mookata, I find it worthwhile with the unlimited flow of seafood. Drinks are unlimited too and the server will come with a trolley of drinks and assist to top up our cups.

For the quantity and money, I will say one can enjoy having Mookata at a budgeted price. If you don't mind spending more on quality style Mookata, there are better ones within Golden Mile Complex."
"Food wise, the mutton curry was slightly underwhelming and on the tougher side and curry was a bit tangy than expected. All items are cheap but would suggest going to your local Hawker centre. They make a  lovely coin prata (crispy, fresh and a little doughy on the inside) but not worth the travel unless you are in the area. Service was quick today (Monday afternoon) and plenty seating available at the centre."
"Very nice mookata restaurant!! Wondering why I didn‚Äôt discover it earlier, maybe I need to explore more! Dishes are offered at a reasonable price $2.20 for most meat dishes and well marinated. Absolute enjoyed it and will visit again!"
"Came here for lunch set, I liked everything from the courses. Was filled by the end of lunch. Great service by the team as well."
The place seemed a little warm but the breakfast set was good. Would go there again  when possible.
"Aunt seller is very friendly.  because of Ramadan They sell a lot of traditional snacks.  I bought some snacks that I couldn't find in other Malay stalls, ‚ÄúGetuk‚Äù which is made from cassava with sugar and coconut.  This stall has the best curry puffs.  But they don't sell sardines flavor today, which is the best I've ever eaten.  Usually they sell in the afternoon, and selling well."
order the beef pepper rice and the taste is soooo good!!! they are very generous with their food portions and the service is really fast too!! really recommended to go there. The cheese naan with the butter chicken is SOOOO good too!!
"Great, tasty food for sharing at affordable prices, though it can get very crowded and queues can be long. Recommended to go during weekdays or non-peak dining hours to secure seats and have a less bustling environment."
"ordered take aways at bedok branch here. ordered their garlic fried chicken, stir fried vegetables. one of the best restaurants i have eaten in bedok. reasonable price too."
"Came to dine on a weekend, so had to wait for table as it‚Äôs crowded. The food is nice and value for money. The beef is done to the medium I wanted, chicken chop also tastes good. And they have Stella beer on tap at a very good price. Will definitely come back again."
"We had:

Classic Chengdu Seabass in Sour Pickled Soup which was seasoned just nice for my taste - not overly sour with a hint of chilli.  I usually dislike seabass but this really changed my view.

Awesome Spicy Chilli Chicken (minus the Fried Dough Twist) which was aromatic with great spicy and numbing flavour.  The little bits of dried garlic in the dish was fragrant as well.

Sichuan Inspired Traditional Homemade Mapo Tofu was a little oily but it was surprisingly spicy.

Stir-fried Jack Beans with Red Chillis and Sichuan Pickles is usually a hit-or-miss dish. Most restaurants fail to remove the fibrous seams but here they have done really well. Each stalk was plump and full of flavour.

Osmanthus Fermented Wine with Rice Balls was a sweet ending to the savoury dinner.  It's good if you have a sweet tooth.

The only thing that wasn't ideal was the plain rice which was probably pre-scooped as the top layer had already dried and hardened."
"Not bad, decent food. Tried their newer items. Felt the chicken prawn roll might have been a tad bland. But the other items were alright.

Service was good and professional"
"Nice malaysian chinese food came here 4 times tried quite a few like laksa, Malaysia lor mee and some typical zhi char food like bean sauce chicken cube rice all nice heard the chef is from Malaysia so far no hit any food not nice taste as if went to malaysia to eat recommend"
"Good food, good atmosphere and good service. Expect a long waiting time up to 30-40 mins without booking, recommend to have a table reservation before going down."
"Generous portions, good value for money and very friendly service. It is air conditioned too. We were staying at the Amara hotel in October 23 and this restaurant was nearby."
I went here after lunchtime since it is the way to easily get empty seat. One of the very few halal Indian food around.
"The oyster was tasty and juicy, with nice flavours and great taste. However, since we ordered this for takeaway and had it when it was a little bit cold, it may not have tasted as good as it should be if eaten immediately, we hope to try this again once dine in is available!"
"East Coast Hawker is a culinary gem that I can‚Äôt recommend enough! The variety of dishes they offer is truly impressive. From the mouthwatering satay and succulent BBQ chicken wings to the flavorful fried Hokkien mee and fried oyster, every bite is a delightful experience.

One standout dish for me was the Sambal sting ray fish, a unique and delicious option that‚Äôs a must-try. And don‚Äôt forget to quench your thirst with their refreshing sugarcane drinks.

The ambiance is great for casual dining, and the staff are always welcoming and attentive. Whether you‚Äôre a local or just passing through, East Coast Hawker is a culinary adventure you won‚Äôt want to miss. It‚Äôs a place where taste buds are tantalized, and I can‚Äôt wait to return for more."
"Super delicious food, super friendly and accommodating ËÄÅÊùøÂ®ò who cut the noodles + chicken slices (pho) so thinly so my bro could eat w his new braces on! Love it"
Definitely one of the best fish soup in Singapore! üëçüèªüëçüèªThe fish is so fresh and the taste of the soup comes with a nature sweetness. And the Owner is super friendly!
"North Indian food here is not up to mark, Though South Indian is ok."
"I read that this place was opened by a local celebrity and has been around a few years, so decided to bring my friends for lunch to check it out.
The dishes were creative and tasty. We loved the raw oyster with a kimchi based sauce and the melt in your mouth Jamon with sweet cherry tomatoes. The cocktails were not very fancy but it was creatively mixed and tasted well.
It is located in a business area so is a good place to entertain business clients or partners or a nice wind me down meal with colleagues after work.
Service was good.
Toilet is clean."
"I loved their curry and Masala Tea, which is quite similar to Ginger tea, but less spicy and more fragrant. Overall price bit on the high side, i guess cant be helped as the location (considered tourist area). Also they kinda shorthanded with 1 pax manning the cashier at early morning (5am ish) and also the server, but carried out order pretty effectively."
"This is the 2nd time to this restaurant, we had different dishes since the menu is flexible. Thumbs up for the cold crab and drunken crab which we had sake to go with it. The other highlight was the beef ball which was told by chef it was freshly made, I also packed some home and would say it is a must try. Overall, the experience was very good with a fair bill."
"Sol & Ora has a lovely dining area and when you go around the 3pm-4pm time slot, the lighting and view is fantastic for food shots and photos! The waitstaff was friendly and kind to us as we were dining and their afternoon tea is delicious and had just the right portions without having you feel too full. Highly recommended and will be back again!"
"Nice, calm and clean restaurant! Good seating arrangement, polite staffs. Poori masala that I ordered was really good. Masala tasted nice and meal was value for money. Neatly packed.
Near to bus stop: Before Geylang Bahru Station (Stop ID: 60031)"
"My to-go restaurant after 10:00PM for supper. Offers a variety of food ranging from Chinese, Indian, Malay, Western and local delights. Some of my favourites include but not limited to their Mutton and Chicken Briyani, Roti Prata, Hainanese Chicken Rice, Seafood Hor Fun, Penang Char Kway Teow, Tom Yam Seafood Soup, Sambal Kangkong and Black Pepper Crab. Friendly staff too. It can be difficult to get their attention if they‚Äôre packed with customers and food delivery orders. My advice is to just walk up to any of them and place your order to avoid unnecessary delays. Will continue to visit. ;)"
The dim sums here are flash and taste very good. The Shao Bao was the best. Should try it.
"Sol & Ora

Located on a quiet level of The Outpost Hotel Sentosa, Sol & Ora is a Mediterranean cuisine restaurant with a Latin vibe.

What caught my attention were the Greek dishes on the menu. The only thing that came to my mind was Ouzo,  a dry anise-flavored aperitif that is widely consumed in Greece.

However, other than some of the Greek wines, I see no Ouzo. I tried my luck and asked the restaurant manager, who is a Russian-Greek, to offer me his private stash of Ouzo.

He explained that as there is only a small committee of Greeks in Singapore, not many restaurants or people will know such a spirit. Well, I'm sure glad that I asked.

Spirits aside, food and service were great. The restaurant manager was jovial and able to recommend wine pairing dishes.

The octopus dish is a must-order dish. The parma hams blended so well with the unsalted octopus and well grilled potatoes.

Food: üçª üçª
Service: üçª üç∫ (Though service was good, dining experience somehow affected by the loud conversations going on in the open kitchen by the kitchen staff)
Price: üçª üçª (For the food quality and service, I'm willing to pay)
Will go again: üçª üçª üç∫"
Loved the sambal stingray and the BBQ prawn. Had the order as take away so the family can dine at the sea side area. The lady is so thoughtful and ensure that all the utensils and the needful are properly assorted for us. We had a fabulous sunset meal at the seaside.
"quality of the food was okay. ambience and outdoor sitting area is lovely. service staff were doing their best but severely short staffed.

portions are a bit small each average cost of each stick $3-4, one prawn would cost ~$8 so a bit on the pricey side. despite being the earlier customer, we waited ~35 min before food is served and it came plate by plate with more waiting in between. udon portion small. many customers around us also waiting and even finished their drinks alr. overall, waited 4/5 of the time and honestly not worth the wait :-( got potential but would not come back cos of long wait :-( and so so food"
"Good customer service, but i ordered indian full grilled chicken  its not same in indian style totally different. They add after the owen some masalas and red chilli, the masala raw smell. I want tamilnadu restaurants style crispy and dry and fully cookied  grilled chicken from owen.  Please take note.. Next time give me..
Thank you so much"
"We had the Omakase set for 108 sgd per person -indeed very interesting,we loved especially the scallops ;too pricey though"
We have 8 pax we ordered medium ‰∏âÂë≥ËôæÁêÉ. They got no more prawns and change to small size. They didn't even check with us is it OK for us and just tell us they change the bill to small don't worry but very expensive 7 small prawns for $20 and we have 8 person not even enough for 1 each. Terrible!!
"it deserve a 2-star, it is worth a detour.

Forgive me if i cant praise this restaurant higher and better.

Their service is excellent, they respect every guests, serve politely and most important, they are able to present their food with confidence, which I don‚Äôt often see that in many Michelin 1-star restaurants.

Their theme is onion, every bit of this restaurant cohere with this theme and very well executed. Every dish has its own stunning way to impress diner, each has its little back story and each is presented in an surprising manner. I appreciated the bomba rice the most as it shows the bravery and innovation the chef has with the food, even it is just rice. Not sure if they call themself molecular gastronomy, but last time I had such innovative experience was in Bo innovation.

And as equally important, I think they are quite generous in using luxury ingredients, like a ping pong size caviar is just pure indulgent.

I don‚Äôt have much Michelin 2star dining experience but among other 1 star restaurants I had in the past, this one is simply the best and deserve differentiation from the rest."
"Overall the experience is good. Visited many times and food quality is constantly good.

We ordered two kind of Unagi but both looks the same. Recommend to try it as its presentation and quality is good. They also have option for Free flow of Yuzu drink @ 6.50 but we had a glass @ 4.50 as my wife wish to try abit. Free flow drinks unable to share or try more than 1pax."
Vegetarian very nice
"First time trying The Nosh burger. It has delicious crispy pork patty coupled with spam and egg. Although normally I choose to get their burger with beef patty, this pork patty also doesn't miss."
"The place is not crowded. The food was simple, less oily but tasty. Their iced Teh C hit the spot."
"The food taste ok but not as good before. Service by Jasmine was very good. She was very attentive, warm and friendly."
Food cmi.. chicken was extremely hard and dry. Tomato soup was WATERY. Steak was ok though standard. The attractive thing for this outlet is the view and the atmosphere. Hope they do better.
"Had a wonder friends get together session at Summer Yakitori! Cozy chill area suitable for friends to gather and enjoy a night.

Would like to thank the boss and lady boss whom showed great hospitality, making our evening a very pleasant one.

Food served were of quality and taste in proportion to yakitori standards.

Glad to have found a place where friends can gather, have some beers with yakitori! Will definitely gather there again."
"The meal has always been good. However the experience with only 1 specific staff has not been great and it is not a one time experience. His attitude was fairly bad and saw that he shakes his head at customers for no apparent reason either right after they leave or from far. This happened on the 2 seperate occasions I have visited. With those 2 times, only saw him interact nicely to a family that ordered wine. But I was sure both times I did not spend below 110.

Unpleasant with just that 1 staff member causing me to not be visiting again."
"Honestly a gem!! The Chili pomelo crab was excellent..! Really loved the pomelo , nice touch to the usual Chili crab but did not detract from the taste.

Crab fried rice was also a big hit and while I‚Äôm not a pork eater, the rest of the crew loved the coffee ribs

Great service and vibe !"
Medium.. not crowded.. so peacefully can sit and eat.. Indian dishes.. but not a great quality.. still home taste far away from homeland.
"Went on a Sunday evening and not too crowded. Spacious area.

Quality of soup is consistent across outlets and staff service is excellent."
Good food. Almost every week we go there to eat.
"A hidden gem that deserves to be discovered! Every bite was a delight, showcasing the chef's skill and commitment to quality. The friendly staff provided top-notch service, making us feel like valued guests. If you're in search of a memorable meal in a welcoming setting, Ding Heng is the perfect choice."
"Really love the decor and ambiance!

Food and drinks is very large portion at a rather reasonable price! Almost 900ml? For $4.50

Breakfast is only 12.90 that is a plate full of food!

The replica of mamashop is 1-1 üíØ you can even purchase the little snacks and toys from them! How nostalgic!

Love it!"
"The dim sum were delicious. Siew mai, har gow, char siew bun, etc were very tasty! I am a repeat customer"
"Nice to be able to take my dog to an indoor restaurant that serves Korean cuisine, as most of the pet friendly places serves western cuisine. Food is nice esp the black bean noodlesüëçand pancake.  Most impt, they have Pet menu. 3 items to choose. The staff passed us a pet diapers for our dogüòÅ.  My dog sat on the chair with us.  The staff are friendly and attentive.  Will definitely ho back again.
Found out there is another outlet, Jeuk Seok Town in Changi that serves BBQ and hotpotüòã  and looking forward to visit that too."
"Damn good food here,staff very friendly and cool,helpful too!highly recommend this place."
"On my visit this time around, I spent around $80 for 2 pax which is quite pricey in my opinion, but we managed to sample a variety of dishes. My craving for Japanese cuisine led me back to this familiar location, as I've had decent experiences with this sushi chain in the past. This time, however, my dining experience was satisfactory but not exceptional. The food was decent, and the service was average, although one staff member appeared visibly discontent.

As usual I'd order their salmon belly sashimi which is acceptable, 3/5, and their salmon sashimi which was disappointing,1/5. Both the sashimi dishes were not fresh at all, and they were poorly sliced. The only difference was that the salmon belly sashimi came in thicker slices compared to the regular salmon sashimi.

Their Chuka Idako, seasoned baby octpopus, were a little too big for my liking. The takoyaki was also quite poorly made. They were a little overcooked on the outside, tasted dry on the inside, and they did not give it enough toppings. Their fried squid tentacles were also a little too salty in my opinion. I also ordered their scallop sushi which was quite tasteless and not worth the price. I tried their promotional dish, the snow crab leg sushi, and it was also not worth it. The crab leg was too tiny. Another promotional dish I tried was the crab chawanmushi and it was the best dish out for all.

Overall, my dining experience here so far has been alright. For the quality, I'd say this place is a little overpriced. While dining here is acceptable, don't expect top quality food or service.

Edit 24/12/23:
I ordered food delivery from here via Grabfood. I had their salmon sashimi, salmon belly sashimi and hotate sashimi. Surprisingly this time round the Sashimi was better compared to when I dined in. The quality was better, it tasted fresher and the cuts were better sliced. I also ordered some variety of sushi and all were decent. What surprised me the most was the delivery time. It was delivered 10mins faster than Grab's prediction despite me ordering slightly past lunch time."
Wanted to share a meal with my partner and he recommended us to go for the $12 option. Another friend ordered a $6 option when the food came and both portion were exactly the same. I asked him why he immediately turn and walked off. Not recommended.
"Beers are overpriced at $15-20, and not much of a view (facing the street). Seating is fairly limited"
"I had my Coin prata with mutton. Coin prata was slightly on the sweeter side. Otherwise, food was not too bad. Seats were available during lunch time compared to the 2 hawker centres near by. That's why I dropped by :p"
"This is the first time i encounter a restaurant that refuse early guest when they are not even half filled. We had a reservation at 7pm, however we made ourselves arrive earlier because we both were excited about our date. Never did we expect that hotel of such calibre would refuse to seat their guest until 15 mins before reservation time. How inflexible.

The food is nothing fantastic. Label of food is wrong placed, some with no label. Chicken rice too oily, satay cooked on hotplate is not acceptable hotel restaurant standard. Maybe the foreigners can accept this. only 4 types of cheap seafood on ice. How pathetic. the Cha soba was over cooked and still placed out for guest. the noodles was mushy and sauce was super diluted. Did the chef even try what was placed out?

Never will i recommend anyone here or return for another visit. Horrible experience."
"Spacious place
Good for dine in
Take away
South Indian-veg non veg
Parata
Beer also available-tiger and Indian beers
Good place for company dinner (South Indian)"
"Collagen soup is recommended. The taste is rich and essence of chicken is well-infused into the broth. Vegetables are fresh and sweet. I feel that for $19, the collagen soup can do better with at least some ingredients in it. Condiments, the leek oil is flavourful. Nanbe chicken could do better with better frying of the batter. The dish tasted a little under fried and batter was soft.

Staff used to be and could be more attentive. The broth was boiling away and they only adjusted the induction cooker upon request, twice. No one came to skim the floating fats off the soup or offer a sampling of it, which they used to do so. Also, there wasn‚Äôt any personal touch to make you feel welcome whatsoever. It was a you say I do approach."
"Cannot meaningfully recommend this. Below average experience. We ordered 3 Med rare ribeyes; one was burnt and sent back, the other was underdone (very rare) but we didn‚Äôt want to send back yet another steak. We ordered 2 lamb chops and sent back 1 for being burnt on the outside. Seafood platter (at 288) was poor; sauce was very one dimensional.

Service excellent and flatbread appetiser was good. Excellent service is the reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1.

This restaurant seems to cater to the patrons of rws instead of being a destination in itself. There are many better steakhouses at a similar price point in SG. The table behind us also complained about the seafood platter. That said, we were told the main chef was on leave the day we dined so perhaps our poor food was a one-off. However, at this price point, much more is expected."
"Went there on a Friday for lunch with my family when I was on leave.  The restaurant is not crowded and we had all the attention from the waiter when we wanted to order the food.  The food also came promptly since there are only a few diners.  We ordered 3 freshly shucked oysters and 3 wasabi tartar oysters.  The oysters are fresh and thick and not surprisingly we  ordered more!  We went straight to the main course without any desserts.   We ordered Foie Gras Jewel Truffle Gyu, Charcoal-Grilled Char Siew Unagi and Spicy Mentaiko Don.  I must say the servings are not that big for big eaters but are sufficient for us as the ingredients are  overflowing the bowls.  Again, the ingredients used are fresh and that‚Äôs very important especially for Japanese restaurants.  We really enjoyed them very much and finished them in no time.  With good service and fresh ingredients, I would rate them 4-stars.   Price wise, they are not the cheapest but also not the most expensive Japanese Restaurants out there.   Would I go back again, yes."
the curry was very very watery like 80 percent water 20 percent curry
"Great little eatery by One Degree Fifteen Marina.

Service is great. Food is good.

Drinks are on the pricier side."
"Great place for a break over the weekend in Sentosa Island, Singapore"
Sambal Pomfret. Tofu. Kang Kung. You cannot go wrong. The sambal is unique. There must be some ground shrimp in there. Very flavorful and not overly spicy. The Pomfret is fried and crispy. Highly recommended.
"Very nice.. !
Taste of hometown..
Will visit again....yummy!
üòãüòã"
"Very short distance from MRT station. The chicken wing is very good; juicy and flavorful with spice/seasoning. The Prosciutto Di Parma pizza is great as well with the parma ham taking the star of the meal. The Carne pizza was good but still fall behind the Prosciutto Di Parma pizza. The tiramisu was okay, slightly dry and sweet. Overall great dining experience, will dine again in the future."
"Went there for dinner on a Friday. Not that crowded, as compare to weekend. Food serve fast. Nice and tasty. Not expensive. Price is stated there in menu. Will go again when eat out with family."
"Prawn cakes were so small, totally different from photos, expensive. Claypot chicken was very salty too. Signature beehoon was so so. Overall very disappointing."
"Decent German fare, shambolic service.
Ordered a pretzel, Salmon rosti and water. Both dishes tasted decent and were served quickly.
Unfortunately, water wasn't served till it was time for payment. By then had I finished my meal. There wasn't a word of apology or a hint of remorse for this regrettable service hiccup.  Say less about needing to pay an additional dollar for the glass of ""refillable"" water that I eventually left without having a sip of.
I  requested to be seated away from the smoking area and was met with a rude response from the server. The lack of proactiveness to help move my plates over sums up the disaster-class from the restaurant,  leaving me to move the plates by myself.

An upsetting experience that I will actively avoid in future."
"01 Dec 2023: Great meal...masala chicken, cauliflower, black squid, fish cutlet and the amazing fish head curry which is not too spicy. Seated in the¬†air-conditioned room is just too noisy for us. We will return for more and will request for outdoor seating."
"Had probably the worst fried rice I‚Äôve ever eaten in my life and it was $16.80. Dry and bland like they forgot that oil and salt exists. It‚Äôs seafood fried rice but there were just tiny dry shrimp, crabmeat tiny balls and the driest fish chunks . I know it‚Äôs a tourist area but for this price this food is not even a tenth as good as any random zichar shop in Singapore. It‚Äôs a shame to serve this fried rice in sg.

Xiaolongbao was mediocre at best and also $16.80 for 6. Stingray was not quite fresh but edible thanks to the sambal we were able to ingest that horrid fried rice. Oh also the vanilla milkshake was $13.80?? The only decent thing was that the $8.80 apple juice was at the very least freshly juiced

Eat here if you want to spend an unreal amount of money on bad food."
3 stars for flavor but 5 stars for serving size = 4 üåü . That was our Pad Thai and Basil pork. Tom yum soup was as good as anything I've had but seems a tad pricey. Service was prompt. No complaints there. Likewise for ambience. Will return for my Thai food fix as there is no doubt they do serve authentic Thai.
"We ordered spaghetti carbonara, pacific dory&tomato salsa, drinks and mushroom soup, all very yummy and value for money"
"Amazing food, amazing cocktails and an overall fantastic experience. Will definitely be back!"
Cheap and good food. Better if can provide some space to eat in.
"It was a last minute search nearing 2 pm on a weekday for a lunch place after a very active outing with our 2 young ones.  My partner searched this place and I called to check if they are opened in the afternoon.  Many restaurants/cafes have their kitchen closed from 2 pm to 6 pm so you can never be too careful.  The man answering the phone was very polite and friendly and I made reservations for a table on the spot.

A very Pet friendly restaurant.  Many patrons brought their pooches with them - Air-conditioned indoors.  If you are allergic to doggie fur, this might not be ideal.

I like the decor and feel of the place.

The menu has a slightly limited variety.  Food quality is good.  Kids meal portion is generous - 2 can share!

Good place to come back to try the rest of the menu although car park could be a challenge for weekends"
"Food standard has dropped by so much, my family and I came down here quite frequently. Especially during special events such as birthdays and we always order their seafood, sambal sotong, sweet and sour seabass and stringray and we used to enjoy it so much. However, today when we came down all the food was disappointing, the stingray look so different, it was wet and very watery not the usual sambal bbq stringray that we ate where the sambal is slightly drier and the sambal look more darker. Their sambal sotong also came in looking very different the sambal was so watery that it looked no different from the sweet and sour sauce. Also, some of their cockles tasted bad like they were spoilt. Approached the staff to give our feedback not to demand any refund or replacement of food, but it seems like they were lazy to entertain and just said it was the same. However, looking back at all the past review and seeing the sambal stingray and now there is clearly a difference. So disappointed and never dining in here again."
"Used to order from here fairly often before the rebranding. Since the name changed the food standard has dropped. The curry was disgustingly oily and the container was split so it spilled everywhere

I am unable to contact you as you have not provided an email address and you have no listed website."
"Excellent food and awesome service! Food took quite awhile to come but as they say good things come to those who wait. We ordered both the pizza special (white sauce pizza with ham, mushrooms n some cheese) and pasta special (lobster pasta). I love that the pizza wasn‚Äôt salty‚Ä¶ Lobster pasta had so much depth of flavor, rest was also very generous with the lobster meat! Our bellies were very satisfied by the end of the meal. Awesome place!!"
A hidden halal cafe in Sentosa!
"Having not had great dim sum for a long time, it was about time we explored a new place in Singapore - that is ‚Äònew for us‚Äô. And Black Society was a great choice. A good variety of dim sum delicacies, at reasonable prices and with good service in a nice environment. It‚Äôs not yet Guangzhou level but getting very close to it! Highly recommended!"
Good comfort food in a central convenient location. Excellent service. Back again in Jan 2021. Maintain rating with new dishes.
"Food was really great here service was amazing. My utensils was changed after every meal.
The atmosphere of the restaurant was very homely, just like those I visited in Italy.
They took note that it was my partners birthday and surprised her. Very lovely staff!
Ordered the 6 course meal at $126/pax, was pleasantly surprised by the no menu food served. Price was a little steep but worth it. Will come again to order other dishes. üòÉ"
"The winning dish is the suan cai broth! Spicy level is definitely there, and the sourness matches it well. Occasionally you chee on that peppercorn and the numbness kicks in. Other superior broths are light in nature but it goes very well with the fish paste. Golden pillows are well done and do use it to soak up the broth for a better unami bite. They offer rice balls for desserts in either soy milk or ginger tea. Menu is slightly confusing though, takes awhile to understood the ‚Äòadd-on‚Äô."
"We really miss Vietnam so we came for Bahn Mi here but they dont have it. Only available at Bedok Outlet. Pho was ok. Taste wise quite close to the Pho we had in Vietnam. But can be better. The fried rice was really yummy, good for children. A little quiet on a Saturday night dinner. They have that familiar Vietnamese vibes. There is a public carpark opposite the building, next to a condominuim. During peak period, carpark was full we had to wait for a while. Hope this helps."
"Mains were uninspiring ‚Äî tasted like elevated hawker food with better ingredients.

Starters, on the other hand, were more interesting and reflect better on the Korean-southern Indian fusion.

Spent about $100/person with 1 drink each (compulsory), which was quite expensive for what we ordered.

We were sat across the grill and could feel the heat. Would try to request for a seat away from the kitchen"
