"India authentic vegitarian wraps and biryani cuisines with reasonable prices and variety, highly recommend",POSITIVE
"Wow! This is so tasty. It's authentic and the salami is salty, so take note. The pizza crust is amazing and so flavorful. Staff are super friendly and welcoming too. Just give it a try",POSITIVE
Super overpriced naan‚Ä¶ 2 naan and small portion of mutton cost $17 at coffee shop,NEGATIVE
"This place serve decent Japanese food but the price is a little high . Given the influx of authentic Japanese franchise in the island, the price tag is still stuck in the 90s (plus inflation). Well if you are in the area craving for decent Japanese food and is not willing to travel less than 10mins to orchard road, then this is the option for you. Set bentos for 2 person set you back at the average 70SGD . Overall is good quality but no wow factor .",NEGATIVE

"Most horrible experience ever. Made a reservation on Quandoo, went down and they told me Quandoo made a mistake because they are fully booked. Our booking was for 7pm and we arrived at 655pm. There were 3 big tables empty at that time. Told me it was for 730pm reservation. If they had let me in at 7pm, some other tables would have been done at 730pm. A family came in later than 730pm and apparently knows the manager. Manager ushered them to the empty at the front. They seemed to dislike the table or for some other reason wanted to change their table. Manager moved them to another empty table inside and suddenly we now have a table. What kind of reason could it be that when a family switched seat there was suddenly an available table? It means that there was a table available all this time? And they waited 45 min to give us a table?

So we finally sat down and ready to place our orders. Waited 15 min to have our orders taken by apparently only the managers can take order. But at this point all the managers suddenly disappeared.

There were flies flying around and I even killed one on the menu. We saw someone‚Äôs Peking duck getting served and they dropped the cracker on the table. The waitress picked it up with his bare hands and put it back on the plate. That was when we know we had to get out of there. We waited 45 min for a table despite having a reservation, 15 min just to have someone come to us to take order. 1 hour for nothing.

Overall a very bad experience and will never be back without even trying their food. They blamed the app but it is on the restaurant to at least have the courtesy to call the patrons and let them know? It is Mother‚Äôs Day and everywhere else is fully booked. Where do they expect us to get a table?",NEGATIVE
"All the pork barbeque are nice. Cold noodle, Kimchi Pancake, all the side dishes, cucumber kimchi, royal kimchi, steamed egg are nice. But for side Kimchi, it would be better if it is more fermented. Personal opinion only.",POSITIVE
"I‚Äôve been here for a couple of times and food is really good, staffs are also really nice, friendly and helpful. Nice place to hang out with your family and friends!",POSITIVE
This is a great alternative to the other restaurant nearby Love their flavourful fish soup and the chicken cutlet was crispy. Highly recommend this seafood restaurant with more than 30 years of experience Chef. If you are lucky you can watch their staff prepare the Giant Grouper fish it is as big as 2 human size,POSITIVE
One time can eat,NEGATIVE
"Very excellent nasi padang.  We had rendang. Ikan sepat, sambal goreng penatin and sayor duri and brinjal. The cost is $14.00 for 2 person. The rendang was very good and the chilli padi lemah is very good. The staff are friendly and helpful. Service is very good. Sure I will recommend my friends.",POSITIVE
"Went for the $65 curry fish head set meal that comes with the following
- 1 curry fish head
- 1 meat (choose between 2 options)
- 1 beancurd dish (choose between 2 options )
- 1 veggie (choose between 2 options)
- 3 white rice

Overall the food is great and very delicious.

The service can be a bit slow (probably due to the lack of staff and it‚Äôs close to the Lunar New Year season), but the food is worth the wait.

Will return again!",POSITIVE
Called to reserve table for 10 paxes but when reached there. They said only have up to 6 paxes. The staff was rude as well,NEGATIVE
Food was meh but the worse part was the place itself filled with flies. Once food is up there are so many flies coming to ur food I forget how the food taste since I was busy trying to shuuu away the flies. Ask the staff about it but there is nothing they can do. Count how many flies were there in the picture,NEGATIVE
"Nice copy place for the Westie, drop by Thursday to Saturday for live band in the evening, otherwise you can still come over to sing through their public sound system.

Service and Atmoshphere is goof, food is on the losing end, every dish we tried taste like 7-11 microwave food but it's fine. We will come for the drinks and live band in future, probably order fries to go with it.",POSITIVE
"Had a really nice experience at Fico. Tables are hard to get so make sure you book nice and early. The food quality is good in particular the fried shrimps and the pasta are fantastic. The dessert items were good but not great.

The setting is very nice and a lot of effort and care has been put into restaurant design. It really makes you feel like you are by the seaside in Italy.

Cost for 2 people without drinks was about $100 a head.",POSITIVE
"Excellent value japanese alacarte buffet
Highlights were thick and fresh sashimi especially the hamachi, Grilled scallops, Wagyu steak and cubes.
Great service from polite staff",POSITIVE
"Pumpkin Soup of the Day was a little watered down‚Ä¶.
Garlic shrimp on the small bites was a lot Better than the main course shrimp
Tenderloin cube too salty and put the coarse sea salt to waste
Burger could be better",NEGATIVE
"Pros:
Great food and atmosphere. Love the chill vibes and the music goes with it nicely. Staff is friendly and helpful. I had a great afternoon here, reading and watching the waves.

Cons :
Food is slightly on the pricey side, preventing frequent re-visits. Would be great if power sockets could be provided as well.",POSITIVE
"This halal restaurant serves very good tze char. My friend brought me to try their fish head curry as she thinks it's one of the best in town! Indeed! No disappointment! Curry is flavourful and rich, fish is fresh! We also had the pandan chicken, home made beancurd, pettai and kailan. It can be a little difficult the get the server's attention when it gets busy. But otherwise, it's a friendly family restaurant and i would visit again.",POSITIVE
"A hidden gem of a northern Indian eatery in Balestier Plaza. Will occasionally visit whenever around the neighbourhood. It serves authentic northern Indian with a few innovative dishes such as tandoori paneer tikka and tandoori brocoli, papri chart and more. The curries are very appetising, especially spicy vindaloo. The staff are friendly and fast service. All Indian food lovers should try...",POSITIVE
"This is my first time visiting. The ordering process is through the QR Code, and payment is made after you finish your meal. I like how the rosti isn't too salty. The cream doesn't add much to the flavour, so you can just eat it with the meat. They do not serve complimentary water so do bring your own plain water. I would dine at this restaurant again.",POSITIVE
"Good place to have lunch, variety of Vegetarian options are available.",POSITIVE
Tasty jjangjangmyeon at affordable price. Suggest to go early to avoid the dinner crowd as the place has limited seats. Serves authentic Korean Chinese food.,POSITIVE
"Food was delicious Italian flavours, but nothing too special. The focaccia with tomatoes was fluffy and fresh. The white ragu pasta was flavourful. Desserts were good too, only found the burrata gelato not to my liking although the recommendations suggested to get it. It was more salty than sweet for me. Service was amazing though. The waiters were attentive, even let us try the wine before serving in case we wanted to change it. The indoor dining space was cozy but very loud as it is a small enclosed space with music playing and everyone talking, so it was difficult to hear each other over the noise. But overall, it was worth waiting 2 months for the reservation.",POSITIVE
"A nice restaurant where best of Thai & Indonesian food can be feasted. A separate Vegetarian menu with options of no-onion & no-garlic makes it a great choice for those Veg / Buddhist patrons. Loved their appetisers, soup, pad Thai & deserts ‚Ä¶ hot lemongrass drink is a must have. Friendly staff made our lunch special.",POSITIVE
"This is tucked in a industrial area which is not very obvious from the main road but it‚Äôs definitely worth it to come as the Yuzu soup based is superb.. refreshing and with the fresh food and beef is definitely a good combination. A must try for their prawn and mushroom paste, fresh and unique taste. Overall price is very reasonable and the owner is very helpful and friendly.",POSITIVE
"Well accomodating to our last minute reservation request! Food was awesome! Except that the cold noodles seems to be different from the usual type outside.

And seafood pancake is better than kimchi pancake. Hehehe.

Lastly it will be good if they can be fast and efficient in topping up side dishes!",POSITIVE
"Really worth the hype and the crazy price tag?

Absolutely yes!

This is an outstanding culinary experience not to be missed. First and foremost, the food is world class. Certainly one of the strongest 3 Michelin star menus I have had in recent times. All dishes were complex and multi-layered in their sensations, yet utterly delicious.

I also really enjoyed the flow of the dinner, starting at the ground floor with some excellent choice of bubbles, first nibbles and the now iconic showcase of ingredients, before moving on to the main dining room.

The wine list seemed well curated. Apart from the obvious super high end choices there was a decent range of more modest options. We had a Savagnin from Jura and a bottle of German Sp√§tburgunder, both excellent and great value.

The sommelier and the whole team were just a delight to interact with. Genuinely friendly, knowledgeable and obviously proud of what they are achieving at Zen!",POSITIVE
"Amazing north Indian food, butter chicken was creamy rich and tasty paired alongside chapati and naan. Briyani was also flavorful.",POSITIVE
"I take personal issues with keyboard warriors that has zero empathy to the elderly owners

Ignore all the reviews that critique at the elderly couple service standards. Both are in retirement and working everyday in a F&B (widely known to be gruelingly laborious) and running the whole operations+kitchen entirely on their own. Cut them some slack. Once, the couple had forgotten my request to top-up the side dish, but you don‚Äôt see my throwing a hissy fit. Be an adult and try to help them so you can get what you need, rather than retreat into your own shell, not get what you want and whining about it later

Have more empathy. What do you stand to gain by destroying two elderly livelihood who are trying to make an honest living. Stop trying to ruin honest businesses with this toxic cancel culture nonsense.

On the main topic - food critiquing:
(+) Food is great, one of the best Korean food in the area. Authentic and reminds me of my days in Korea. Nothing in Singapore comes close to authencity of the Korean food I vividly remember

(-) Food selections are few, not a Korean BBQ place if you‚Äôre looking for one but sells Korean cooked food

"First time having lunch here. We had to wait a few times from order time (understandable) but also between each of the dishes. Maybe it's the system. I would have thought all dishes ordered by  each table should be served before serving the next table. Especially when in a hurry, we could finish faster this way. But no, 3 dishes came out of the kitchen went to 3 tables. Chilli and sauces are self-served which is both good and bad. I didn't know so asked a waitress, She told me to help myself and she went away, so I helped myself. Perhaps she could serve this time since we asked. A surprise was the complimentary soup that came with a set meal,... üëç",NEGATIVE
"Tasty meats, dips were okay, but the star was the kunefe!! So good we finished one and ordered a second kunefe lol texture was crispy, chewy, meaty and the amount of syrup was just nice, not too sweet!! LOVE IT!",POSITIVE
Came here for its thosai masala. Never disappoint at every visit. Pair it with iced teh halia(ginger).,POSITIVE

Vibes great.

Pouring today so having a coffee inside, looking out. Perfect lunch.",POSITIVE
Ordered Dum Briyani with chicken thigh n gave me rice that came with pieces of chicken with some sauce that has got nothing to do with a dum briyani. Asked for Dhalcha n was given fish curry!! Who eats briyani with fish curry??!! If you do not have dum briyani then don‚Äôt publish it n sell!! Totally spoilt my mood and Totally upsetting!!,NEGATIVE
"Kind of local zhi char but in aircon environment. Food is average and a little bland. The Belado fish kind of overly fried and dry. The curry fish is average, the fry sambal kangkong perfectly cooked  as it taste crunchiness ! The sambal fried lady finger with prawn is tasty. The tahu goreng was great and the Penang fried Kway teow was just so so... the portion per serving is huge and don‚Äôt over ordering your food! Great service and friendly waitress!",NEGATIVE
"Old school zi char coffee shop with good quality food at reasonable price. Must order is the hainaneae pork chop which is by far the crispiest hainanese pork chop I have tried.  The sambal tapioca leaf was surprisingly tasty though it looks quite boring. They are quite good with them soups and some were already sold out when we went in the evening.  I can't comment on the squid as I am not a fan of squid.

It's a nice, unassuming place to enjoy some nice, simple dinner.  The lady in charge is quite busy but very helpful and efficient.",POSITIVE
"Sin Ming Roti Prata serves up very well done pratas in a coffeeshop that has a decent selection of foods. Their menu is extensive boasting 19 different sorts of prata (whether they are available all day, I'm not sure)!

Ordered 1 egg and 1 kosong today and paid $3.30 for that. A look at their cooking process shows 4 people around the prata grill, 2 'shapers' and the main prata-flipper whom I assume is the boss, leading his other subordinate over the grill. They also seem to cook it slower, and with less oil used compared to other establishments.

The kosong was served fluffed up, whilst having a decent enough amount of crispy parts. The egg prata felt like i was biting into a soft pillow of dough and egg. Very enjoyable indeed! Their dough has a tinge of sweetness to it too - I would know since I have my pratas without sugar or curry. Honestly, they are one of the better prata shops around, and their daily morning crowd is proof of that.

"Very careless staff at drive thru. He said he checked my order. I went home to find out that he missed out items. When I drove back to the drive thru, another staff said he had left. Wasted my time and getting cold food!",NEGATIVE
Sharing the bbq meats and japchae. Meat is nicely done and japchae is flavourful. Portion is nice for 2 pax. Service wise is also excellent! Definitely be coming back for more!,POSITIVE
"Ordered via foodpanda. Mala was soggy. Bamboo shoots are too old, woody. Not something I would order again.",NEGATIVE
"Food quality is decent. However service here is inadequate especially if you arrive around 5 pm when the change of service staff is ongoing. Then the whole restaurant is served by 3 staff! Literally you would be ignored by the staff if you wave at them.

Even in the US store in Chicago, the staff member lowers their body to take orders just like in Japan which is a form of courtesy towards customers. In Singapore, there‚Äôs no such service and I don‚Äôt expect it. I just expect the staff not to ignore me when they obviously saw me.",NEGATIVE
"I recently placed an order with Phoenix Restaurant for a family gathering. The culinary offerings were exceptional, garnering unanimous praise from all my guests. The service provided was commendable, and the delivery was prompt. I am thoroughly pleased with the experience and look forward to engaging their services in the future.",POSITIVE
"Really disappointed with meal here. Also disappointed with owners response - why not accept failings which are obvious from the pictures rather than blaming customer! Shame manager wasn‚Äôt present but on reading response not sure how would have helped. Rival accusation is frankly rediculous and slightly embarrassing!
Pham Quyen restaurant did seduce us with lovely looking baguettes in the window and we relished the prospect of some pho and banh mi. Sadly despite the numerous baguettes and cooked chicken on display (see photo) was informed that as there was only one chef the restaurant had stopped any orders. I mean seriously no one else other than the head chef could put together the sandwich. The mood wasn‚Äôt helped by the 45 min wait for a bowl of average pho and minimal beef, which I was told was down to a very large online order. I think this place would benefit from prioritising customers in the restaurant and cutting down the menu to banh mi and pho - seems odd to me that ever since the old manager left they have decided to extend the menu. Would like to say that this is a one off but had a similar experience. A few weeks ago! Not sure will be back especially after reading mangers new comments !!",NEGATIVE
"Went to Kelly jie seafood for a birthday meal, food was great, very friendly service too! The placw is quite small, so best to book before going! Definitely try their crab beehoon, we even asked for soup and noodles top up (with additional charge). Will definitely head back to try their other dishes!",POSITIVE
"The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, with many sports enthusiasts frequenting the place. The alcohol and food are both of high quality, and there is live music featuring a beautiful singer. All in all, it's a great place to relax and enjoy good food, drinks, and music in a warm and welcoming environment.",POSITIVE
"the staff dont wanna serve us man we came around 11 and there were no seats and my friend asked the guy but he literally ignored her so >:(

in the end we dragged our own chairs and went to the counter to order and then 10 mins later THEN the guy comes and asks for our order

but ok after we ordered alls good the food was alright. prata was bussin, maggie goreng was bussin",POSITIVE

the tastes is ok, the taco not so flavoured, a bit plain; the linguine is tasty, good portion;
Chicken wings are very dry and hard to bite, feel not so fresh.
Environment & atmospheres: 5/5
Definitely the views and the vibe are fabulous! I love to visit different beach club and this one is clean and relaxing; pet-friendly , good place to take a breath from hustle and bustle life.",POSITIVE
Perfect lunch fix. Great value for the Lu Rou items during lunch. Cool and spacious seating area to beat the heat.,POSITIVE
Newly opened food place that served affordable and generous portion of halal food. My personal favourite dish is the mutton soup. Price is great at $6 for the amount of mutton. The soup is good for cold and raining day. I feel warm after having the soup. Fun and friendly staff who showed the love sign at us when we signaled them for help üòÑ,POSITIVE
"Delightful cafe situated beside a pretty scenic sight! Enjoy good food & also the nice sea breeze! Come here at night and be wow at the vibrant night life & f&b scene! We ordered:

Seafood Mix Platter, Pizza, Buffalo Drumlets, truffle fries, lamb wrap and a few of their recommended cocktails!

Food were flavourful and we appreciate how generous the portions were and we can agree that the seafood is pretty flavourful and yummy! The fish fillet is particular memorable!

Definitely a great place with a good selection of Mediterranean food!",POSITIVE
"Ordered a triple meat plate adding an omelette and eggplant. Food portion is huge value for money but am surprise to see the pathetic amount of curry, (maji curry is a curry house rite?) hence requested for extra curry for an extra charge which is fine with me. The part i find seriously unacceptable - they insisted me walking to the shop entrance to just make a payment first before i can continue with my food. Definitely my last visit here, too stingy on the curry sauce compared to monster curry. I told them upfront i will give them 1 star anyway. Lol. Adios!",POSITIVE
"Can‚Äôt decide to give two or three stars.

Unfortunately the food was served really slowly on the day we went (Saturday night).

We ordered risotto, duck leg confit, an appetiser and two drinks. The duck leg confit took more than 40 mins to arrive. What was disappointing was 1) the table next to us received their duck leg confit before us even though they arrived later, 2) when it was finally served to us it was small and burnt. As we were too hungry we decided to just eat it anyway, but one of the staff saw the duck and offered to change it for us. If it weren‚Äôt for the staff we will be giving two star for this review instead of three.

Our dessert also took longer than expected to arrive (almost 30 mins after we asked for it to be served, even though we placed the order when we arrived).

The mushroom risotto and the appetiser tasted good though.

Overall didn‚Äôt really have a good experience.",NEGATIVE
"The service is amazing, staff were attentive and friendly. I ordered the beef moussaka, the layers of taste was amazing. The mushroom soup with the truffle oil is another level! If u love mushrooms, u will definitely love this! The Parma ham pair with melon is legit! üòã‚ù§Ô∏è will come back to try their other dishes! The atmosphere is perfect for date nights ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòâ ask for the balcony seats, it‚Äôs romantically decorated üòç",POSITIVE
Mee goreng is nice. Stall holder is also very polite.,POSITIVE
Paul at T1 all the way left at C gate. The counter staff is gave a warm welcome and cheerful and polite. The place is cosy and nice! Definitely highly recommended  to stop by for a drink while waiting for ur flight!,POSITIVE
"Food was okay. Portion was small. Definitely overpriced, especially considering the ulu location. Generous spacing between tables though.
We ordered 2 pax set menu ($60) which was corn cheese + spicy stir fried chicken + deep fried pork for two people. We had to buy burgers on our way home for the dinner again. I‚Äôd rather going to other Korean resraurants in the main road at Tanjong Pagar for the similar price to get more proper dinner. It is far from everywhere and located  in the hawker center building. But still more expensive than other stores in the better location‚Ä¶
The taste of foods was seriously, just average Korean. Nothing so special. Perhaps I expected too much after seeing the hypes in the google review.
The atmosphere was impressive though. It has a retro-Korean vibes with thoughtful touches of music, lights, and furnishing items. Tables are pretty well-spaced from each other, not like some Korean restaurants that make you eating squeezed by each other.
Oh also be aware that water is not free here. When we sit down and ask for ‚Äòwater‚Äô, they served the cold barley tea. I thought it‚Äôs nice as some authentic Korean restaurants serve barley tea rather than just ice water. Later I found $3 is charged for it on the bill.",NEGATIVE
Very bad customer service. One guy in restaurant don't know how to speak with people and is not customer attentive. People wait for him for long time to give orders. Really very pathetic service.,NEGATIVE
"Ordered Onion Egg Prata
Best at 2am. Full of onion + crispy! The fish curry is full of flavour. üëç",POSITIVE
Fries isn‚Äôt crispy. The rest is fine. Gave a 2 star for service as there wasn‚Äôt enough service crew during a weekday dinner. Pretty obvious that they couldn‚Äôt manage.,NEGATIVE

"wow, i had a really enjoyable dinner!  the yuzu-themed dishes were very good!  the yuzu soup and waygu were very yummy!

came here for dinner during less busy weekday.  ordered one Signature Yuzu Shabu Set with A5 Hokkaido Snow Wagyu and one Ishiyaki Hot Stone Grill (yakiniku) Set with A4 Wagyu.

the service was good, and the ambience was good & quiet.  the generous spacing of seats and the tall ceiling made the environment felt very comfortable.  easy parking right outside.

a hidden gem in this area!!",POSITIVE
How come masala tea is $2 and also it was very watery and smelly. Do you provide Quality food for Worthable price?,NEGATIVE
"I am going to say straight up. The hokkien mee is terrible. Cooked by an auntie.
I regret ordering 2 packets. I googled and was kind of recommended by Seth Liu.
There is NO hokkien prawn mee taste at all. Super bland. It‚Äôs just plain fried noodles that any anyone could fry. I forced myself to swallow half a packet.
The previous local guide who said the hokkien mee was flavorful probably hadn‚Äôt tried hokkien mee before in his life.
Try it at your own risk",NEGATIVE
"Tasted one of the best ""Nool Parotta"".
It is served hot and parotta has several layers. It is served with delicious Chicken gravy. Literally , the Parotta took me back to the streets of Madurai, India.",POSITIVE
"This place gave me Malaysian Kampung vibe. We decided to have an early lunch here. The dishes were leaning towards a Malay kampung dishes (lauk kampung). Wide varieties of choices and the dishes we had were tasty, and transported me to some kampung in Malaysia having these dishes overlooking a padi field.

The simple and humble Grilled Cow Fish was perfectly cooked and served with savoury soy, fresh chilli and diced onion as dipping was so good (you can ask for sambal belachan). Very kampung style. üëçüèª

The asam pedas fish roe feels homely and the broth was wholesome.

Squid ink dish was nothing lack of spice goodness.

Sitting capacity is quite limited so it‚Äôs best to come early or just ask for a take away. We‚Äôll return to try other dishes.",POSITIVE
"Beef curry is good, standard Japanese curry, not spicy. The $2 top up chawnanmushi is lack of favour tho. I think they just use water to make the egg instead of using dashi. Overall I like it, the curry is good. But probably won't come again with this pricing. Total damage sgd$16.8",POSITIVE
"I found this restaurant on google and I must say the taste of food here was really good. Staff, Owner and Manager all were really nice to the people visiting them.

This is the only place which is offering pure north Indian taste in north Indian dishes. I saw restaurants in Singapore where North Indian food was being cooked in coconut oil or I could say in South Indian style but here it was not the case. Cook here is really a master.

I was in Singapore for a month and for almost every day I choose this place for my lunch.

Must try lemon soda it is very refreshing and delicious.",POSITIVE
Good for affordable and quality meal. Huge portion for our mutabak and nasi goreng.,POSITIVE
"Hot Tomato Bistro is a western resturant with good soup. I ordered mushroom soup, the Hot Tomato Mixed Grill and chose onion rings for that side and to finish it off, lemon tea. The mushroom soup is quite nice and warm, the onion rings are crispy and the meat was somewhat too hard for me. Staff quite friendly with them bringing stuff you need and the tables are relatively clean. Overall, good place to eat steak and other western food.",POSITIVE
"Gem in the heartlands. Portion sizes are great and value for money. Service was also awesome, food quality is there. Must try!

Oyster omelette: not too oily, was just nice!
Kong ba with buns: meat was slightly tough, but flavour is there
Fish maw soup: very rich!",POSITIVE
"First visit since the pandemic. Needed a refresher on how to do the okonomiyaki so we paid the additional 10%. In any case, if you ordered other teppanyaki sides it‚Äôs easier to just sit back and watch üòÇ
Everything was good, though the A5 wagyu was pricey as expected ($55!!). The gyutan (beef tongue, $13) would be a more value for money choice.
If ordering other dishes, best to share the okonomiyaki.",POSITIVE
"we had a pleasant dinner , one of the best mussel & suckling pig we ever had

key highlights of the food is , mussel , lamb , suckling pig , mussel was awesomely good , lamb was perfectly done & well seasoned  , suckling was so amazing crispy on skin tender and juicy mesf

service was great , something memorable is having a really cheerful person serving us .

overall is a really decent meal , would really recommend the dishes stated above  .",POSITIVE
It's ok not bad,POSITIVE
"Pizza was just nice, very enjoyable and not overpowering taste! Not my first visit and will go again. Restaurant atmosphere is cozy and comfy. Good for dates or family! The service staff were also friendly.",POSITIVE
"Very Tasty food,",POSITIVE
"It was a little squeezy for large groups, had 8 people booking. So do not recommend for big groups.
Nevertheless, the food was rather decent. Pizza and tiramisu was great. Servings for pastas are quite small, and can be better.",POSITIVE
"Service is good here, a malay lady was very attentive to our table when we require service. However, despite the high rating, food fell short of our expectation. Description of the physical menu and menu in the ordering page differs which made us feel shortchanged. Food is pretty pricey too while the quality was just not that great. Presentatiom could be better too,especially for the fries.

Ordered the following and here is my take:

Lamb chop - tasty and well cooked. Mashed potato is well seasoned too! Do share this dish though as you might find the lamb surfeiting after awhile.

Burger - was ok but patty was not well cooked. Could do with more sauce.

Chicken steak out - was ok, not the best chicken. Note that this does not come with calamari as per order page's description. Please update!

Strawberry latte - just a disappointment. Literally strawberry milk with shot of espresso. When mixed, it doesn't compliment each other. Can't taste the coffee too. For $10+ after gst? Just no.

Spicy chicken and fries appetizer - chicken is not even spicy the least bit :/ would have been good to have chicken coated with some spicy seasoning powder or sauce.

Overall, it was ok but there are better cafe hangouts. Location is quite a distance from bishan mrt too but good if you want to grab a meal after a workout. Place is quite squeezy too so it's not wheelchair-friendly or kid-friendly if your kid needs a baby chair.

Would i come again or recommend this place? I'd say please reconsider if it's for a celebration. Casual dining is fine but don't have very high expectations.

Nice deco for photos at the entrace! Outdoor dining is great for bigger groups too.",POSITIVE
Food was out of my expectations... although is lunch set but the pork chop was seem to be frozen and not cook enough. The egg was seen to be not so nice and the most ok is the sushi rice. Overall the environment was nice and staff was good. Need to improve on food quality control and the speed of food delivered...I ordered on 11:35 but I am only able to start eat at 12.02pm and in between the customer surrounded me is less than 10person. I felt amazing for this from Singapore. Think twice before u really decided to have lunch here.,NEGATIVE
The food taste so great. Just like having the Korean food in Korea.. very nice. The tofu is so smooth.. the teppan marinated chicken is really good. Dukbokki is in small plate but just nice portion. Will definitely come back again..,POSITIVE
"Reasonable price, friendly staff, good food.",POSITIVE
"Went for midnight supper in a group with children. Table top was dirty and couldn't get anyone to clean - cleaned on our own with wipes.

My friend and I came here for breakfast and we ordered prata. It did not disappoint. The prata was crispy and fragrant. And the accompanying curry was tasty. We enjoyed our prata! It was delicious!,POSITIVE
"Had visited for a farewell lunch for 1 of our team member.

Food was great, will recommend the kebab platter (comes with rice) which was shared by 3 of us. Chicken wings were also great and were presented in Swish Kebab style.

Bread was also freshly made, as it was fluffy and hot on arrival.

Mains and dessert options were also varied for vegetarians in our group and good as well. Tried the Kunefe with ice cream for the first time as well, which was delicious.

Overall, we'd enjoyed ourselves in the experience",POSITIVE
"Not ordering from these guys again.

Garlic baby kailan: absolutely bland and tasteless. They do give a good amout of kailan, but hardly any garlic.

Salted egg squid: so mushy you wonder if it's all breading and no squid. Turns out it's both. There's a thick layer of breading that's mushy and soft around the squid, AND the squid is soft it makes you wonder how fresh it is.",NEGATIVE
This restaurant served nice Indian cuisine at Mount Faber SAFRA door step and member gets discount for meals ordered but the dining place is small so avoid crowd visit on weekdays non peak hours.,POSITIVE
"I went to have dinner with my wife and a friend today at 8.30pm, I ordered curry chicken baked rice along with the others. My wife and my friend have already finished eating their food, pizza and ravioli. My curry chicken baked rice still did not come. I asked one of your staff who was wearing black shirt (a foreign girl. Not sure if she's Thai or Philippino, she was very rude to us. She said this to us. ""So you want to wait or you want to cancel"" I repeated again that you guys made me wait so long for my food and she repeats so you want to wait or cancel? Then she walks off. Not even apologetic at all.

Very bad service.",NEGATIVE
Second time here. Good selection on beer on tap. Counted total of 9. Good crowd and nice service. Will come back again when I am in the hood.,POSITIVE
"The food at Tasty Court never disappoint us. They've their special sauce and dishes which can't find in other Chinese restaurants. Due to good quality and freshness of their ingredients, their prices are on the high side. Minus point is the location and limited parking space.",POSITIVE
Came here 1st time for office lunch. Service was great and staffs were friendly and helpful. Food was delicious and the spread overall were good for a lunch. Manager Gopal is professional. Overall experience is GREAT,POSITIVE
"The buffet was a pleasant surprise, was not expecting such quality of food in the area. Decent variety of food choices and love the seafood selections. Food was replenish promptly and service staff were friendly and helpful, including the hotel lobby staff.",POSITIVE
"This restaurant's presentation is like a work of art. My friends are pleased with my choice, and we're all happy! This will be our go-to dining spot in the future! But hope it can increase the speed of serving food.",POSITIVE
"With 3 men behind the counter and it took me 20min to walk out of the store with a takeaway Egg Mayo sandwich. Movement is slow and alot of time wasted.

Only good thing is, this is the only fast food in Tuas.",NEGATIVE
The duck and chicken were very good. The roasted pork and barbecue pork were of average. The staff are friendly and parking lots can easily be found.,POSITIVE
"We enjoyed the fish burger, fish and chips and also the Kampong fried rice.",POSITIVE
"Went to the outlet at one-north with my family for the panipuri but it's not to our expectation.  The filling is cold and the pani to dunk the puri in was bland.  We had other items such as rawa thosai, bhatura and ootappam.  They're quite alright but u can get nicer and cheaper option at little India.  The buttermilk and lassi are really good.",NEGATIVE
"Vegetarian Horfun/Beehoon available.
Dry and wet options. That's the only options available for me. But I'm glad I don't have to go hungry after a great morning out at sea.",POSITIVE
"Service crew here was welcoming and friendly.
Especially Karl. He was so nice and very helpful..I would definitely bring my kids here again..not just for the food but their service..5 star for their service",POSITIVE

"Value for money, able to sing and play pool table/games, nice place to hang out.",POSITIVE
"Fish and chips, pork ribs tasted very good. Interesting variety of craft beer including local flavours like pandan, jasmine, ginseng (for the adventurous!)",POSITIVE
"Found amongst the highly competitive stretch of Korean food at Amoy street, it's seemingly lesser crowd is not an indication of their food quality. Superb lunch deals and at really good standards too! We had the seafood tofu stew and ginseng chicken and they were both great!",POSITIVE
"I have no idea why the waiter at the entrance was so anxious, he seems overwhelmed with the amount of tasks.
He cannot control himself with the frustration on his facial expression, he seems too busy, all the tasks was delivered half way, for example, he didn‚Äôt bring me to the table, but point a table and told me I can sit there.
The menu does not have photo to provide reference, so I asked him for his recommendation, he mentioned 3 must try, but I can tell he is thinking we are wasting his time.
Apparently he is not the only one doing that, the other waiters are busy too, when we wanted to ask a waiter to help us fill up water, they pretend they did not see.
I hope Violet Oon can at least provide more staff to maintain the quality of service.
Good food by the way.",NEGATIVE
"1st Visit dated on 3rd week of April 2023.

Our 1st try Nepalese food and ordered the chicken Momo and fish N chips as good reviews from netizens.

The exterior appearance really looked like the chinese xiao long bao but the texture tasted like siew mai instead. The sauce slightly spicy.
Must eat it when served hot because cold already the exterior skin hardened.

We applauded their well done fish N chips and the discounted price for senior customers.

Definitely will be back again especially to try their western food again.",NEGATIVE
"Flood are just not the best. Mee goreng are not well fried( not cooked) after I complained and they changed. This is the second plate. I guess that all they can do.

But their prata I will give 7 out of 10 and the hailia( too diluted) and taste the ginger but got no tea and milk taste. I will say 3.5 out of 10

Ice milo. I give it 9/10",NEGATIVE
"The famous Chilli Crab! Leaving the price aside, the crab is good and fresh. The sauce is well done and we finish the whole thing. The price is daunting however. 1 kg crab costs SGD111!! So it is probably nice experience but never to be repeated üòÖ other dishes (crab fried rice, spicy fried green bean and calamari) were ok not spectacular. The Peroni beer is good though. Really thirst-quenching!",POSITIVE
"Nice, clean and most importantly aircon eatery at very reasonable price. Staff is friendly and polite, serve to table. Portion is huge, good value for money!",POSITIVE
"Nice cozy atmosphere with a good variety of food options, from western to japanese to chinese. The oysters are great as well!",POSITIVE
"Nice place for Chinese cuisine fine dining. 6 course dinner, with tastefully selected dishes to go along with. Every course tasted well, particularly the cod fish and the dessert. The dessert came as a surprise as it comes with the popping sweet bits. Something that you won‚Äôt get to eat elsewhere. Manageable crowd and service was prompt. Will return :)",POSITIVE
"Purveyor of high-end Catalan cuisine. The offered tasting menu purports to be an overview of the restaurant's offerings, but has some notable misses. Service is attentive, though slightly pushy, while ambience is excellent on a quiet midweek night. In all, given the variable quality of the tasting menu, I would probably recommend going for ala carte versions of dishes you are actually interested in eating.

Liked:
- Galician octopus and pork belly. Honestly the best thing we had, and is unfortunately not included in the tasting menu. I think it should be - it's an excellent and easily-portioned showcase.

- Of the tasting menu:
- Amuse bouche was suitably amusing: a shot of unseasoned yet highly fragrant mushroom stock.
- Salmorejo soup with jamon ice cream was an interesting starter, though I couldn't really taste the jamon in the ice cream.
- Of the tapas courses, the croquette and bomba were standouts, especially the surprisingly spicy and piquant sauce underlying the latter.
- Stuffed Cannelloni. The presentation (a single sad-looking cannelloni spooned over haphazardly with a thick sauce) is unappetizing, but it tastes pretty good.
- Catalan creme brulee was excellent and a satisfying end to the dinner, as were the petit fours served after as a nice gesture commemorate our special occasion.

Ambivalent:
- Of the tapas courses, the toast-based tapas (the jamon and the anchovies) had toast that was a bit too crispy - when you bite into it, the toast breaks up and gets all over the table. In the case of the jamon, because of the way the jamon is shingled, it's all too easy to end up eating a whole piece of ham with your bite of toast, so that you're left with excess toast and no ham at the end. Basically the mechanics of those dishes doesn't quite work.
- Seafood Fideu√† from the tasting menu. Carabinero prawn wasn't the freshest, and the short-cut noodles themselves had a sort of rubbery overfried texture while not being as flavorful as they looked.
- Crispy suckling pig with strawberries from the tasting menu. The suckling pig is good, if normal, but the presence of fresh strawberries strikes me as odd. Thought it would be good as a compote or something.

Disliked:
- Apple and Fennel salad, separately ordered. Honestly very meh; the one-note vegetal quality of the fennel overpowers the dish, burying the taste of the apple. A dish that doesn't really come together.",POSITIVE
"Great place for sashimi and sushi. Like a marketplace where you can choose pieces of seafood and they cut and plate it for you at no extra cost. They also carry Japanese cooking ingredients which you can buy. Great menu at very reasonable prices.  In particular, their chirashi sushi.  Even their gindara is reasonably priced.",POSITIVE
"Pricey, big plate with small portion, there‚Äôs service charge too. Spent $40 for 2 pax for subpar hawker food. The food did not go down well with my stomach. Had mild diarrhoea with grinding stomach, even gotta pop charcoal pills.",NEGATIVE
"Indulge your cravings for authentic German cuisine at Brotzeit. The menu boasts an extensive array of dishes, my favorite is their rosti paired with crispy pork belly, complemented by a refreshing Kale salad. A family-friendly place, they accommodated our needs by providing space for our pram, catering to both a baby and a toddler. The venue offers both indoor and outdoor seating, affording a great view of the harbor. Children are well-catered with their kids menu.

I‚Äôm impressed with the cocktail selection, crafted to perfectly complement their German beer offerings. This haven has become our go-to spot for weekend lunch outings, and the added value of membership truly enhances the overall experience. I recommend this gem for its outstanding value, cleanliness of the restaurant and welcoming staff.",POSITIVE
"Went to have dinner on 18 February 2024 as have passed this restaurant several times. Was totally surprised by the quality of food. We tried the seafood hotpot and it was really yummy. The ingredients are fresh and the banchan was amazing. Fell in love with the lotus root, mashed potatoes with anchovies and the homemade kimchi. One word ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù. The Makgeolli which is fermented rice wine, brought back memories as it is reminds me of a Peranakan desert something like glutinous rice wrapped in banana leaves and then leave to ferment over time. I highly recommend this family restaurant. Excellent. The staff is super friendly and very helpful if you need some recommendations",POSITIVE
"For less than $30/ pax, you get free flow servings of seafood, meats and drinks (including Thai milk tea and ice-cream!). Definitely a must go place for mookata lovers. Coupled with the unique Thai ambience of the building, I am loathe to share this but since the building is about to go soon‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt miss it!",POSITIVE
"Top tier service, staff were extremely friendly and insightful ‚Ä¶ they would frequent our table to check on how we are doing.

Food was amazing, presentation on point very picturesque. I would highly recommend coming here",POSITIVE
"Beautiful and nice decorations in a nice neighborhood. Food was nicely presented and beautiful.

The menu was messy, they don‚Äôt categorize to appetizers or main dishes. Some of the dishes, the size are tiny as appetizers but the price is like main dish. Overall portions were pretty small and it‚Äôs confusing. Ended up 65 SGD per person but still not filling‚Ä¶",POSITIVE
"I feel they can improve the quantity/ quality of the food they are charging.

Ordered coin prata chicken set and it came with ""2"" chicken breast cube.",NEGATIVE
"They now have two rooms next to each other. We were allocated to the second one because the first was full. However, the experience was not so good. As we almost waited 40min when the food was finally served. If you looked at the second picture, the egg already solidified while the meat was not served. They seemed to have short of hands. Food was good. But the service really wasn‚Äôt nice. I had a poor experience although I visited second time. Minus two stars for the super long delay of the meat and the chaotic services.",NEGATIVE
"Reputable place for teochew food.

Steam promfret is their famous dish. Didn't disappoint!!

Yam Orh Nee is smooth and not so sweet..

Other dishes are average but the coffee pork rib is dry and tough.

Was also disappointing that some of the dishes are off menu such as Oyster omelette and braised pork belly.

Service staff are not approachable. Service is slow during peak hours.

Portion is small for the price paid.",POSITIVE
"I read through some past reviews, and it seems that their pastries are great, but as for the sandwiches, everyone has had a similar experience to me, overwhelmingly chewy and dry. I recommend adding sour cream or some sort of sauce to the sandwiches, which would enhance them greatly.",NEGATIVE

"A rare gem for Tzechar in the heart of Macpherson! Dishes were all highly recommended by a close friend and all tasted fantastic! As the saying goes, always follow the Âú∞Â§¥Ëõá! Not crowded for a weekend but I doubt it will stay hidden as this is definitely a 5 starred restaurant. Highly recommended to try the ones in the photos.",POSITIVE
"I want to be fair here
I came and ordered garlic Nann and butter chicken
They gave me curry chicken and refused to acknowledge their mistake
This meal turned out to be a salty curry nightmare
The meal was exorbitantly expensive and curry was at best salty poor
Poor mistake no recovery not a desirable place to come back",NEGATIVE
"A Cozy Izakaya that transports you to the land of the rising sun!

Food served were delicious and fresh!",POSITIVE
"Food, service and ambience are all 10/10! We've been here a couple of times and everything tastes good so far. They also change their menu every once a while:
- Wara-smoked tuna: 5‚≠ê
Fresh and tart, great appetizer.
- Roasted duck breast: 4.5‚≠ê
Very generous with the duck and love the sauce and veggies. Duck is very tasty, but just slightly gamey for sensitive taste buds.
- Squid ink risotto: 5‚≠ê
The risotto tastes great and the presentation is super cute. Veggie puree at the side compliments the dish well.
- Tiramisu: 5‚≠ê
One of the best tiramisu in SG. Very generous with the rum.",POSITIVE
"Went on Christmas Day and the dim sum lunch buffet pricing was $49++ for adults. It was really worth the money! Stuffed myself silly with many dishes that not only look good, but taste delicious. The ambience of the restaurant is quiet and spacious. Group of 10 for a table seats comfortably.",POSITIVE
"Good service provided here. Food is consistent as other outlet standards. Despite valentine day, there is large crowd and orders, staff is still attentive and proactive nonetheless. Highly recommended !",POSITIVE
"Excellent food, great ambience and fantastic service from their staff. My go to place for Korean food.",POSITIVE
"The place is always crowded and could get noisy. Used to off their delivery apps as they could not managed.

But recent visit, staffs are kinder and friendlier. Likely after Covid they managed to employ more staff.

Food is authentic and seasoning is just right.

Also everything is a hit.

Prices are slightly higher, if u considered the fact that they are not a restaurant setting eatery.",POSITIVE
So so so so good. We tried the original fondue (delicious) and then the mushroom fondue (even more delicious). Recommend pairing it with a nice fruity light wine to offset the delicious and filling meal. Staff is helpful and service is super fast. Book in advance as it gets busy extremely fast.,POSITIVE
"Fish ... is thick.

After a few places tried,  I guess this will be where I go when I need my sashimi fix in jurong",POSITIVE

The food is delicious. I love the burger. The service is great too. Love the fact that they serve water FREE. Dislike restaurants that are so cheapskate and charge for still water. The sizzling brownie.... must try!,POSITIVE
"This is how every burger shop should make their beef patty. Super juicy and fragrant. Bun is soft. Definitely one of the best burger I‚Äôve tried. But i am quite disappointed with the fries, nothing special.",POSITIVE
"Drinks are a tad too sweet, prata is not crispy but taste well. Mee goreng is good! A chill supper place for everyone.",POSITIVE
Famous Japanese BBQ brand new opening in Vivo City! Went for lunch as one. Clean and spacious interior and plenty of lunch options as well. Went for the Sukiyaki set meal. Tender and delicious thinly sliced beef with lots of healthy vegetables and soft boiled egg for dipping. Will be back for dinner with friends!,POSITIVE
Food was awesome and service was 10/10! Definitely worth it to come by for lunch and the wine pairing was great! Portion control and timing took to serve each course was on point!,POSITIVE
"The grilled free-range chicken probably had a good life running around, and certainly didnt skip leg day. Chicken leg was really dry and doesn't taste fresh. Mashed potatoes was probably free-range as well or the farmer never water his potatoes enough. But overall the food is still edible as I'm not a fussy eater, this is just my humble opinion.",NEGATIVE
"This Penang restaurant truly captures the authentic flavors of Malaysia. While the prawn noodles might not quite match those in Penang, their fried noodles are genuinely delicious. Moreover, they offer a delightful Â•∂Ê≤πËôæÂßë, while in Singapore, you probably only able found ËôæÂ©Ü instead. The cendol is also excellent and highly recommended!",POSITIVE
Very good service from the Johorean Indian captain.,POSITIVE
"Visited in Jul 2023

The last time I had visited Rhubarb was 4-5 years ago. So a revisit was a long time coming. Good food and great service as always. There are 3 options/dining experiences you can choose from. I went for the most comprehensive one - 3 starters, 1 main with chef‚Äôs premium ingredient and 1 dessert.

While I can see how Rhubarb has been able to maintain its 1 star for so many years, I struggled a bit to find some key differentiating factor versus other French contemporary Michelin places. Good food nonetheless.

Service was really good. The dishes kept coming fast and I was done with my entire dinner in an hour.

All in all a very good dining place. If you haven‚Äôt been there, it is definitely worth going.",POSITIVE
"A hidden gem for craft beer lovers.
The brews are daring and various, with decent quality and reasonable price.

"Visit Date: 19 Nov 23

This was a busy evening at the Silver Shell Cafe. When we made the booking about 6 hours earlier, the restaurant reservation concierge was not sure if we could be seated inside. A month earlier we had a quiet dinner at the same pace but it was so warm and sultry, I did not enjoy either the ambience or the food.

Today we had opted for their buffet sitting inside and it was wonderful!
We were served by the same Thai lady who had served us a month earlier. She was very attentive and accommodating.

The Sunday theme was ""Singapore good Ol' Days"" and Boy! Was that Good!. The spread was exhaustive!
There was a salad bar, cheese, bread and charcuterie, a small spread of sushi, seafood station with clams, scallops, prawns and mussels.
At the Indian counter there was a delicious tandoori fish  along with a reasonable spread of veg and non veg options.
In the live satay station, beef and lamb satay were the best. There was a spicy sambal prawn to die for. The roasted lamb was ok. They also served a coconut chicken ( don't remember the name) which was the tastiest with rainbow coloured rice.
On another end of the hall was roasted duck, char siew, olive rice, chilli crabs and many others.I cannot even name all.
The dessert bar was quite exhaustive too. The bread pudding was very good and so was the creme brulee. The gula melaka sago was a little bland in comparison to others. There were assorted tarts cakes and fruits. The  pandan kaya and lapis cake were very good
We had shiraz to go with it all. Wine by the glass was quite comparable price-wise to any other city restaurant.
Delicious food in a great ambience. it was priceless family time.",NEGATIVE
Casual and fuss-free dining experience. Staffs are always friendly and attentive. Porridge taste consistent every time I visit. The black fungus appetizer that came with the set was refreshing. Spent around $13 for a quick and delicious meal.,POSITIVE
This is a great place to chill with frns or family. They serve very decent lunch and dinner too. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç,POSITIVE
"one of the best zhichar in the west.
the place is not big and tables are limited tho.",POSITIVE
"My dad‚Äôs favourite place for fish head steamboat so we went there for his birthday lunch. We chose the badang fish option which had no bones so that it‚Äôs easier for everyone to eat. The soup was sweet and delicious and fish was fresh. We also ordered their signature homemade tofu, prawn paste chicken (prawn paste taste is strong!), qinglong vegetables, clay pot pig liver and all were good. My favourite is still the soup. Will come back again but recommended to make reservations for big groups cause the restaurant is quite small.",POSITIVE
"I recently had the pleasure of dining and take away at Nandhana‚Äôs Restaurant in Jookoon, and it was an exceptional experience. The food quality was outstanding, with every dish bursting with delicious flavors. The service was impeccable, thanks to the friendly and attentive staff who made our visit truly enjoyable.

One standout aspect was Manager Nadhan's remarkable responsibility and dedication. He ensured that everything ran smoothly, adding an extra layer of excellence to our dining experience.

The restaurant's welcoming atmosphere made it a perfect place to enjoy a meal with friends and family. Overall, Nandhanas Restaurant left a lasting impression on me, and I can't wait to return for more culinary delights. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
"Location is a bit out of the way. Food is good and reasonable.
Some hit and miss, stingray is good and the 3 cup chicken it ok only",NEGATIVE
Lamb taste and food quantity are really great. Really cheap on what we ordered. Recommend fried cumin lamb ribs. Only the decoration is kind of obsolete.,POSITIVE
"First time visiting..
Generally positive experience.
Pizza and Pasta worth a try. But price is on the high side, not wallet friendly.

Lobster bisque and lamb rack is a miss.

Truffle fries nothing fanciful - miss.

Service is average only.

Washroom available on site.
Carpark available on site.",POSITIVE
"Food was decent but service was excellent. The staff helped me greatly with the food recommendations and she was very patient.

I also managed to get a seat near the rain vortex so I had a nice view while dining.

I had the lunch time promo (1-for-1 chicken chop) and it was good! The chicken was served on a hot plate which was still sizzling when it arrived and it was juicy and the texture was not too firm. There‚Äôs also a section where you can play darts with friends and I like how they separated the two areas so that dining section is not too noisy so that normal conversations can still be held.,POSITIVE
Went to pizza hut bedok yesterday with my family to have lunch. I was amazed how the staffs accommodate us with outstanding service most specially from Sylvia.

"Food was amazing!! Octopus Leg is a must for appetiser - best polpo I‚Äôve tried in Singapore! Pasta has good portion and really good too! The meat platter was best for sharing - the lamb was really good! Service is great, Francis and Jordan were really helpful and even suggested wine choice for the food we ordered. I‚Äôd come back again for sure!",POSITIVE
The food at this place is definitely above average if you are willing to wait. Be prepared to wait minimally 30 mins even for takeaways. Been many times. Had to wait for 1hr on one occasion. We were famished but the food did not disappoint.,POSITIVE
"My whole family was a saffron's briyani lover.. I travel from the west to the east just to have the briyani but now the standard really dropped way out.. First, the order takers at the counter couldn't understand English & got easily irritated.. Most Importantly, the food wasn't hot at all.. when asked the staff, he set they forgot to on the stove for the warmer set.. The rice, curry & the chicken wasnt hot. Best part of it is we went at around 1pm which is lunch time.. So disappointing!",POSITIVE

"Had early dinner around 530pm on a weekday. The ambience and setting of this outlet is really nice and spacious. The booth seatings in the middle of the restaurant are very cozy and the way it‚Äôs designed, it still gives you privacy between tables.

Food is good, consistent across the various outlets I‚Äôve been too. Mamma Mia is really a place you can keep coming back to again and again with friends and family to try different menu items and be assured the taste and quality will not disappoint every time.

They launched a new set menu! Limited options but a pretty good start. Extra compliments for the lemon parsley risotto I had today. Butter had a hazelnut flavour and the rice was creamy and refreshing at the same time. Very well prepared by the Chef.",POSITIVE
The overall food is delicious. The presentation is good for photo taking too. The only thing that makes me feel sad is‚Ä¶ add spicy need to top up $1.50 but there got a spicy powder on the table. I really cannot! Really feel like being chop‚Ä¶ i cannot give full stars for this !,POSITIVE
Great Indian in Sentosa cove and lovely staff serving. Delighted with this and well worth a visit.,POSITIVE
"Food came relatively fast with the exception of the Teochew olive rice. We checked with the server multiple times regarding the order but she brushed us off with ‚Äúit takes time to steam‚Äù without even checking with the kitchen. After an hour of waiting we decided we had enough and asked to cancel the rice if it was not ready and it turned out that the kitchen did not even prepare it as there was a glitch in their system. The staff was not apologetic at all and merely said she would cancel the order while the other staff who took our order came to apologise as she did not check with the kitchen and assumed that they were preparing the food. This situation could have been avoided if they actually went to check on our order instead of brushing it off.

Edit:
They gave us a 10% staff discount to apologise for the issue.",POSITIVE
Super noisy and echoey place. The sounds from the staff keeping and laying out the plates plus the tons of kids running around made our dining experience hell. Went specially for dim sum but was informed that they were not available. on a Sunday üòÇ samsui chicken and spicy potato leaves were good but everything else was average.,NEGATIVE
"Honestly a lousy meal.    The so called claypot fish head is $23 and tasted so fishy.     I stopped after 2 mouth.     The soup within is starchy type  with 4 tofu and 2 tan pieces.  The beef hor fun is so so.    The sweet and sour pork is good

Not worth the trip here",NEGATIVE
"Affordable and delicious sushi! Every rice is coated with unique sauce that is paired with the meat/vegetable topping u order. Extremely love the pork slice sushi and always order it everytime! The udon was a little hard but I enjoyed it still. The dessert choices are plenty compared to other sushi restaurants I know and I love it!

Glad to enjoy a complete meal here! The service staff are friendly too and the I got my seats fast even on a Saturday evening!",POSITIVE
"Nice french restaurant. Service workers very nice and polite. Food is solid. Please try the BBQ chicken. It's nice. Dessert glass made of plastic, cannot carry my dessert spoon, other than that, it's all good.",NEGATIVE
"Quite a nice supper spot. Halal eatery! Has food from standard prata to ikan bakar to ice desserts to butter chicken! Place is generally quite clean!

Many different stores and huge variety of food to choose from. Just sit down and wait for one of the servers/waiters to come to you. Everything will be ordered through them! Pay at the drinks stall after you are done eating!

Opens till real late too so its a big plus!",POSITIVE
"Al Hadheerah is located at the basement foodcourt of Toa Payoh hdb hub.

The ko-song roti prata is oh so nice and has a ‚Äúcrispyness‚Äù to it.

They have some promo value sets which are sold at a slight discount vs ala carte orders.

Try having the prata with the fish curry. Very nice!!",POSITIVE
