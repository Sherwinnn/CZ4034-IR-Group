"Dropped by for dinner & there wasn’t a crowd which was great 🙂ordered the cheese and garlic flavoured with chicken korma, with a chicken kebab.
Naans were chewy and texture was definitely one of the best I’ve tried 🥳 chicken kebab came in a bread/pita instead of a wrap but it was delicious.

Side note: they have a huge variety of food on their menu and everything is priced reasonably!"
"Our first time to try the food here.the food was nice but the thing that impressed us was the service from Mr.Rayner.As you know restaurant in Singapore services are very normal and they just do their job even in some Michelin star restaurant.But Mr.Rayner service was exceptional and with warm hospitality!!!
He was so friendly and polite also instructed us to be careful and show us how to handle the hot sake.it’s a small detail but his service make you feel like you are eating in Japan."
"The curry is nice, I like it better than Monster or Coco. It was rated as No 1 curry in Japan as per the shop. Tonkatsu could be juicier though. Will come back again!"
We had an absolutely divine birthday lunch. Everything was great and perfect and love the food!! Highly recommended.
Our number 1 choice to go when introducing turtle soup experience to our family guests🐢the soup is so good and they also allow a third to half portion of soup refill btw. Must eat with the yam rice! Staff are always very warm and hospitable. 5 stars🙌
"My mum told me this stall have been here for many years. The foods are good, seafood taste nice and fresh too. The menu show a lot of variety and mostly in text, so to prepare to read through the menu as the prices are a bit on high side. However the portion are big and service are excellent. The waiter Mr Bon from Philippines can speak many dialects and madarine. The waiter and waitress serve us very well. The crabs is the star so prepare to pay for it. The drinks are expensive too."
Waited for 30 mins for my food staff was messy and dropped food on the tables and floors. Missed my number and took 5 mins just to tell them as they just kept ignoring.  left my food out and my drink cup was falling apart. I asked for table service and the staff walked past me I had to stop them and bring in myself. Didnt even take my number. Food was cold and stale because left out for so long. Table was sticky and dirty
"Food was really good! Much better than expected! Beef patty of the burger very fragrant, and chicken cutlet very well marinated! And the fried mushroom, super yummy! Definitely prefer this place over Astons! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 and very cute robot waiter 🤩"
Disappointed with the whole Korean chicken moment. Taste nothing and look nothing like the poster. You can see the picture attached.. Maybe the cheese fries taste like KFC’s and that’s all. Chicken burger came cold too. It was only 11.20am in the morning and they also almost got our orders wrong.. Ain’t visiting it again.
"Beautiful outdoor seating area. Great skewers at reasonable prices. Most importantly, lady boss is very friendly and accommodating."
"Despite the industrial canteen setting, don't be deceived—this place serves incredibly delicious food at remarkably affordable prices. I'm a frequent patron, especially when I have visitors or during special occasions. The standout dish is the chili crab—it's generously portioned and bursting with flavor. In fact, I find the value here superior to many pricier, touristy restaurants. The affordability is a definite plus."
"Chef Marcus and Chef Jonathan are brilliant. Their take on modern cuisine with a Singapore twist is spot on with their flavors and textures. The service is warm and attentive without being intrusive. An absolute win, highly recommend!"
Before fight food! I enjoy their services since the food is delivered quickly and the noodles are amazing! Excellent advice for a time traveler in a hurry
Decent place to eat on Saturday. No waiting because the place is very big. Fresh ingredients and very tasty chilli.
great food at an affordable price! good for sharing
Nice and cosy environment. Staffs are friendly. Food is nice. Will come again.
Very bad customer service. Walked in to get take away. There were 2 staff on duty and no one came up to take my order. Restaurant was 90% empty. One aunty at least acknowledged my presence and that was it. The other person avoided eye contact all together. I never felt so invisible. Ended up leaving as clearly I was ‘not there’.
"Good view facing MRT station.
Western food. Wide choices. Good ice cream selection. Crowded during peak dinning hours.
**Found the meat was not tender in the curry chicken baked rice"
Avoid at all cost unless you really cant find any food around your area.
"Jubilee is a strange place indeed. A restaurant that's not really a proper restaurant per say. Looks like Safra wanted to maximise its rental income, so they simple compartmentalize the ball room into 4 sub dinning areas and leased them to Jubilee to operate as a restaurant! Good is that we booked 1 table and hv the whole sub dinning hall to ourselves. Bad is that next dinning room is hosting a D+D of sorts, so we had to put up loud noises as they had a karaoke competition for entertainment. Believe you me, wasn't that pleasant when you have to put up with extremely terrible loud voices screaming into the mike...not quite the SG got talent show!😰😱

Foodwise, the quality is surprisely decent and not the usual mass produce type of food. Out of the 8 dishes on offer from the set CNY menu, I would say only the last 2 dishes....fried rice wrapped in lotus leaf n the red bean soup with glutinous rice balls are so so. The other dishes are good. Tasty and generous in portions. I liked the shark fins soup and stewed abalone with mushrooms especially! (Ok .... No disrespect to those anti shark fins activists...its just my personal choice). The prawn ball in oat flaks was also brilliant...piping hot, fresh n crunchy. The fish was humongous! Also quite fresh so would have been good if it was simply steamed instead of cooked with bean paste sauce. Still good nevertheless.

4 stars for food and 3 stars for the 'loud' ambience. 3.5 stars average. Perhaps good to visit the main branch in Katong."
"The iberico pork belly melts in your mouth, i kid you not, it’s super fatty, like 80-90% fats every piece but it melts beautifully inside your mouth, 100% perfect. The seafood pancake is not your traditional Korean pancake, it’s thin crust, crispy with lots of chives, so you either hate it or love it, we loved it!  The spicy chicken stew is pretty normal, it’s nice but no wow factor. We also ordered the semi dried squid with butter, it was tender and juicy, just the way we liked it. To be honest we weren’t expecting the quality of the food to be good due to the looks of their menu, we paid $151 for 4 which breaks down to about $37 ish per pax, I would say it’s value for money given the quality."
Very authentic food (you know when koreans patronage). With so many panchan. We tried the sundubu and green onion jeon. Flavorful up to the right level. Service was well. They served us yogurt drink after meal as well. Price was very reasonable. Will come back again. Near downtown line.
"Had a celebratory birthday lunch here - their lunch sets are really worth it! The chirashi was great and the fish was fresh, loved the concept of placing edible flowers in the mix as well. I had to order their famous uni wrapped in wagyu beef and it didn't disappoint - was worried that the raw beef would have a strange flavour/texture but it melted in my mouth and i had to fight the urge to order it again ($16 a pop!)"
"Been awhile since we came to this Sakunthala and noticed the price increased significantly.
We always like the Naan meal that is served with Masala Chicken (can choose) and also the Butter Chicken is good too. Portion is quite generous.

Something to improve: seats arrangement. The space inbetween seats are very tight, especially for the 2 tables nearest to the entrance."
I went for the beef intestines jeongol and it was just tasted like what I had in South Korea! Very authentic and delicious! Will definitely go back here again if I am missing the food!
"Our lunch today left us thoroughly satisfied. Here's what we enjoyed:

🦐 Tom Yum Seafood Soup (Clear)
🐷 Grilled Pork Neck
🐟 Fried Seabass In Thai Chilli
🦑 Stir Fried Yellow Curry Sotong
🐔 Stir Fried Spicy Chicken
🥥 Coconut Ice Cream with Red Ruby
🍹 Iced Lemongrass
☕️ Thai Iced Coffee

Their skillful use of spices in sauces and dips amazed us. While the dishes are fantastic on their own, the dips add a new layer of flavor. I was especially surprised to discover a hint of tamarind in the dip that accompanied the Grilled Pork Neck."
"Should be the top 5 Chinese vegetarian to go to in Singapore. A veteran vegetarian restaurant in Singapore. All of their dishes are good, and not to mention about their service as well. However the price is slightly at the higher side but overall it worth every penny you going to spend. Do give it a try if you happen to drop by Chinatown!"
"Long time favourite Chinese restaurant, been coming here for years. Guo Bao Rou is a must order. Skewers are good too!"
"Other than one server who made us stand around our table, the rest of the them were superb and attentive. Especially love talking to a mature server who is enthu in sharing the food and services they are providing.

Food is awesome, tasty and one of the best black pepper crab we have.

Do make your reservation at least a week in advance cos is really popular."
"Trying Bali Thai after a long while on 15th Jul.

Decent taste.
Service was ok.

But be sure to act fast if the server is cleaning your dishes.
There's still half of the food in the plate and the server wanted to clear it away luckily we stopped him.

Maybe he can asked if we still want it before trying to clear it."
"Ordered maggie goreng with fried chicken and egg.
The chicken was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. The egg has a good toast at the bottom while maintaining a runny yolk. Only gripe is that the maggie goreng was undercooked, so it lessened the enjoyment. Still a good spot for a meal."
"Paneer shashlik tikka. The worst ever tikka I had in my life. No flavours at all. The chutney as can be seen in rhe photo too much color is added and not at all a tikka chutney by taste. The onions was stale. Had to throw away the whole dinner.

The chilli mushroom was so oily it took me a second glance to understand if it is dry or gravy.
The schezwan fried rice was full of added color. Pathetic flavour profile.

Had ordered paneer tikka masala few days before (pic not attached) , the color added stayed on the fingertips till the next day.

This restaurant is using way too much color in the food hence the pics look delicious. Perfect case of ""Don't judge the book by it's cover""!

Deliveroo is the delivery partner and as many have reviewed already they have zero say of your food is late. The restaurant phone number kept saying busy for 45mins at a stretch. Deliveroo said we cannot help you contact the restaurant and solve ot at your end!!!!!
Pathetic restaurant and pathetic service!!"
"My first time here in this quaint ""underground"" bar with a regular. My expectations were low, but were blown past sky high. I was thinking I was stepping into an Italian restaurant, as the name would suggest, but was told to try the local food. With major skepticisms, I succumbed, but was very well impressed.

(My photos will not do this place justice)

Pork Knuckle Bee Hoon - very fragrantly stir fried beehoon made this simple sounding dish very complex and flavorful

Special Oyakodon - Non traditional way of preparing oyakodon, but also very flavorful and appetising

Spam fries (not pictured) - ""that's how you prepare spam fries"".

Enough said. will be back for more"
"Here's what I ordered:

1. Tom Yum Pasta
2. Da Bomb Burger
3. Waffles with Fried Chicken

I'd highly recommend opting for the bundle deals, which cover 2 mains, 2 drinks, and a dessert. The servers were impressively attentive, and their milkshakes are a definite highlight! Plus, the outdoor setting is exceptionally Instagram-worthy."
"Coffee-fair
Food- Mainland Chinese, individual cooked food, roast meat, Indian food , Malay chicken rice store and another Malay cooked food store"
"Food was absolutely terrible and overpriced. Aglio Olio tasted very bland and the hamburg steak portion was pathetic it tasted like a mcdonald’s patty in meatball form and had no other sides but just veggies.
Total for this with two can drinks cost $42, vibe there was just the owner inviting all his other friends over for fun."
"In general, the ban chan or side dishes at this restaurant were well prepared and tasty. However, we were disappointed with the bibimbap and cold noodles as they did not meet our expectations.

One of the main drawbacks of our dining experience was the lack of attention and initiative from the staff. Despite the fact that the restaurant was not crowded, our food took quite a while to arrive at our table. This lack of efficiency was quite frustrating.

That being said, the dishes that we did order were all enjoyable. While there was nothing that particularly stood out to us, overall, it was a decent dining experience.

The aircon was down during our visit and it was really warm."
"3.5/5 Prata Kosong: Nothing wrong with the prata, its decent but not great
3/5 Nasi Goreng Ayam Kunyit: To be honest, this is pretty decent too but the downside is for the price, the small quantity and size of ayam kunyit received is just... sad."
"Swensen's at Clementi Mall serves very good burgers. I've tried their impossible burgers on a couple of occasions, and more recently, the Classic Ultra Burger. The patties were juicy, smashed till they're very tender, and cooked just right. The secret sauce wasn't too overpowering, such that I can still taste the original flavour of the beef. The melted cheese was the icing on the cake. I also ordered their mocha, which is nice and not too sweet."
"We were craving for prata in the area and remembered of this store that has been there for quite some time.

It’s a small no frills kind of shop where there is a Kampong vibe to it. Everyone know everyone.

We had masala tosai, cheese egg prata and Maggie soup which all were pretty good!

Will be back"
"The place we intended to go was closed, and so we walked around and came across this bar. Was a little hungry so we decided to try their fish and chips. BOY WAS IT AMAZING. So glad we didn’t give it a pass just because “bar food ain’t nice”. Had sausages that were great too. Drinks are reasonably priced, and just a real chill place to hang."
"The CKT is sinful, decadent and has the traditional flavours shining through every bit of the plate. Although just a tad on the sweet side but I ain’t faulting this one bit cos it takes a hell lot to keep the tradition and recipe alive and passed down thru’ the generations and for that the price is well below the premium this food commands. So the next time, I am just going to wait patiently  in line till it’s my turn to receive my plate at the altar of CKT."
"First time dinning here, tze char is just Infront of the prawning pond. I think I had one of the best fried rice today. It's very well done not super oily, awesome flavour and wok hei. Fish head curry is a must order, family took turn drinking the gravy after hahah, spicy lover I think can request the chef to add chilli level to it otherwise their standard one is very comfortable and yummy. Sambal sotong also one of the best. So good. 👌"
"not much atmosphere. typical buffet set up. Food was of good quality; fresh! Sashimi were in generous cuts. Good range of sashimi.
4 stars instead of 5 because the other spreads lack variety.
food were a bit slow to serve at times but understandably since there are made upon order."
"I was in wheelchair when I went there for lunch. The seats were spacious enough for me to be seated at the green tables.
My mee goreng was delicious and they added fried chicken as requested.
My son's fried rice with chicken was also good. His plate was clean. Husband's mutton chop came with pineapple slice and bread. He was delighted.
We were happy customers. Thank u!"
First time here for the fish and the other dishes . Not bad and portions are relatively big. Well recommended for second visit. The customer service is good. The only sad thing is they don't serve a plain water free
"For those who prefer spicy Indian food is good n good wide varieties.
Thali earlier have 3 veggie including crispy fry… but only 1 veggie which is potato given. Along with dhal , sambar n rasam
Need to be back to original like other branches
Must try when been to jewel Changi
Need to improvise on roti
Rice quantity is too much might ask for reduction if u think it’s too much so food will not get wasted .
I feel thali is not health due to addition ofnpotato very instead of other n it’s expensive of $12
Special non veg include 2 small chicken piece n 1 egg cost $18.50 felt not worth although which ever good served was good .
Can make it better like before same other other locations as this place more of travellers visit"
"Straightforward Heng Hwa cuisine located near Tampines round market. Menu's avail in S,M,L portions. First visit. Ordered all small plates to share as we wanted to try a bit of everything. Had Lor Mee, Fried Bee hoon, Fried Tenggiri fish, fried caramelised yam cubes, sweet sour lychee pork, braised bean curd and pork jelly. Verdict: tasty, heartwarming, value-for-money Putian food. We arrived early on a weekend dinnertime and snagged the remaining 3 tables before they got busy with dine-in/takeaways from 630pm. Coming back to try other dishes."
The chicken wings are absolutely delicious. Plant balls with cranberry sauce superb as always… salmon quiche so special…
"Hidden gem that you won't notice from the outside. But once you walk in the atmosphere is great.

Nice beers on tap and food is pretty decent.

Will come back here again."
"Very unsightly atmosphere, tables not cleaned eventhough plates are cleared by customers. Customers have to clean the tables on their own to dine in! The tray return station are full of trays of plates etc thus prevent others from clearing their tables."
"Had a lovely lunch here, though the outdoors is a bit hot but can’t complain with the beautiful scenery and great service from Mr.Guna. Totally enjoy the pizza!"
I only order at home and only breakfast. Great food and good value for money. Veg options.
"Wonderful food, great ambiance and nice staffs!!! Definitely a must go restaurant 💕💕💕"
"One of the best sichuan/china cuisine restaurants we’ve ate at in Singapore!

We ordered the sour veg fish, spicy oil beef slices, roast pork neck meat, and pork dumplings. Loved the dumplings and the spicy oil beef!!! Must order!!!

Will definitely visit again :))"
"The food not only tasted terrible, its unhygienic. Found a fly hidden in the kimchi!!"
"Service was on point! Every staff that attend to our table inform which is which dish. They were accommodating and patient with us. Even gave us a complimentary cake for Mom, Brought my fam out for Iftar and celebrate mom's birthday.

Due to Covid restrictions, food is brought to the table instead, and food is just a click away from your phone!
Love that the food was served in small portion. So you know no food will go to waste! No dish was served cold except for dessert of course! Hehe

Every single dish was scrumptious! Overall, fam is super satisfied especially Mom too ... If you're into Mediterranean food... here it is."
Crispy and fluffy pratas. One of my favorite pratas in Singapore. Be sure to come before the lunch crowd.
"The number of dishes on offer at this eatery is mind blowing! We ordered the Mee Goreng Pattaya (meat free) for myself, Tulang Soup for my dad and Butter Chicken w Rumali Roti for my mum. All the dishes were tasty, and reasonably priced. However, the price of the Lime Juice was pretty steep at $4.50 per pax.

Staff are very kind and helpful, so kudos to them for their wonderful service."
Just basing it on one bad experience. Rest were good. The one time I had chicken it upset my stomach. Veg? No issues there at all. The meals are pretty good actually
Didn't know of this hideout and was happy to be brought there. Great ambience. Nice live band. Good food and most importantly it's affordable! Plus point because you can bring your fur baby along! Recommended 👍🏼
"Tucked away in a corner of Pasir Panjang, this
cosy restaurant should be familiar to the folks working at Mapletree Business City as it is along a row of eateries just 10 min away by foot.
The cuisine and staff here are authentic Thai, attracting a diverse clientele here for its good food. At my visit, I spotted an Indian family as well as a group of locals with their Caucasian companion.
The food is redolent with the spices of Thailand, imparting that flavor that tells you, if you close your eyes, that you are in a little part of the Land of Smiles, despite knowing otherwise. No doubt, the chatter in pasa Thai adds to the illusion.
Portion wise, the food is served in hearty quantities and speedily.
We could not eat fast enough - the food was that tasty.
Esarn Thai is definitely a must-visit if you are in Pasir Panjang!"
"This branch follows the usual format of all McDonald's outlets, so there are no surprises in terms of store layout and experience. It is not so big, though. Expect crowds during peak hours. I've observed that the size of the burgers has gotten smaller -- sighh!! Another victim of shrinkflation. Taste remains the same, so at least there is a reason to keep coming back."
"Tried the lobster rolls with truffles and the promo $8 pint of little creatures. The bread was well executed and the lobster portions were chunky.

Felt a little hungry after the meal. Could be better with some fries. The beer was good but unlikely to order if it’s back at $15-16 per pint. Not quite sure if there’s an option for wine as well.

There ain’t much seating at the moment, could be due to covid. Happy to revisit during off peak but will unlikely queue for this on weekends. Worth a try."
"This is one of those places that surprised me with the quality of food, ambience and even service. As a lover of Greek food, the search is ongoing for the next better one. And I  I have found this next better one for sure. As we are not big eater, the hummus, the ring bread (I suggest go for the non wholegrain one as it is softer), and keftedes (beef balls) already filled both our stomach. Will definitely be back here to savour their other dishes, especially the highly recommended grilled lamb chop, and baklava."
"Happy hour oysters going at $3 each! Foie gras was decently cooked, an expected texture and taste. Though, I wasn’t a big fan of the Char Siew Unagi, would prefer the usual one we have. Else pear or yuzu spritz are suitable for ladies too.

Kitchen service was slow, waited 45 mins for the cooked food when we ordered at 5.15pm, which is kinda of off peak."
"Lovely Lunch at East Treasure !

Well executed dishes with warm friendly service staff !

Will visit again !"
Oh there is no more archipelago beer! What a pity ! Actually I saw the archipelago beer is IPA beer but only take erdinger! Good enough
"Mentaiko fries is off the menu!

Great service 💯 and not bad drinks 😊"
"The crab omelette is amazing and a must have.
The tomyum is not bad, a bit more heat than your usual fare.
Had the mama fried noodles, that was great too!
I personally enjoyed their cool lemongrass drink.

Come early to get space.
If anything, I'd ask the shop to move the ashtray directly in front of the shop as that's where families sit outside in queue."
"We ordered 2 sets of Japanese Wagyu beef and 1 set of Australia Wagyu lunch set. The Japanese set was better than the Australian set due to the thickness and marbling of each piece of wagyu meat. I think the $12 differences is worth it.

The usage of charcoal grill was a plus point as it provided the immense heat and smoke that had added the charbroiled, smoky taste into the food that gives barbecued meats their unforgettable flavor.

Occasionally, the sudden blazing fire from the charcoal added the extra fun experience.

Overall, a good place to visit for charcoal bbq meat!"
Good
Great Thai place around the area. With a variety of choices to choose from and at a cheaper cost. Fun place to have your friend gathering occassions.
"Food selection was great. Had a good meal. However, do expect long waiting times. They seem to be understaffed."
"Hiii! I’m not sure who waited me to the table and also took my payment (was the same person), he has provided excellent service!!! No complaints even though my truffle fries came longer than expected, but the service here won me over! Thank you so much to that waiter! My name is Alfred, made a booking at 715pm! Please provide a raise to that waiter if no raise maybe a glass of cocktail, on the house from Tanuki Raw 🤣"
"Had the loveliest time here. Margaret and Shidah made it even lovelier with their top notch service and ensured we're well taken care off. Oh ya, the food here is just heavenly. I reckon the service we got made the food even nicer. Variety of choices, well ventilated, well-lit area and the food is well prepared too! We had the nourishing chicken collagen soup and laksa broth. I have to urge you to get the fish paste (in the collagen soup!) and prawn paste (in laksa). It is out of this world, ladies and gentlemen. So if you're looking for a place for hotpot for a great price. Suki suki is it. And it's HALAL!"
Everything was deliciously marvelous! Fantastic blend of French cuisine with Japanese ingredients.
"Great service here, staff are very attentive and nice. The food is yummy too! Will definitely be back."
"Absolutely fantastic service and work etiquettes from the crew.
Often when it’s go time, people loses their composure and succumb to pressure. The men of Tambi operated smoothly and efficiently, making sure their guest feels comfortable. Certainly an underrated aspect of the restaurant.
A fusion of two different cuisine in extreme polarity come together unexpectedly well.
Personally my favourite is the Pajeon and the sweet tender ribs briyani.
Can’t say much about the other mains but overheard the customers beside us talking about the Lamb chops.
Definitely the next on the list!"
"Moments ago, I ordered butter chicken for $10 at the restaurant. I even showed them a picture of butter chicken and they said its the same just different colour. It tasted like zhi char's salted egg yolk chicken."
"Excellent service and the waitress always check to ensure we have plates, or help us clear the wastes, monitor and serve the next dishes when we are done with the current dishes so we dont wait too long but have enough time to take a break. The food are fresh, delicious and the yam paste is super yummy. Will recommend the food and excellent service! Restaurant is also clean and aircon is nicely set."
"Dinner Gathering with my friends. First time eating at a Shake Shack outlet (I kid you not 😊). Suakoo me have tried Shake Shack Burgers, but it’s the tapao version by hubs.

Ordering from the Self Service Kiosk was easy except for the part where I had to verify myself (cos I ordered ShackMeister Ale & Shake Shack needed to ensure I’m not under 18 😉)

Asked for help from counter staff who then gave me the passcode. I tried a few times n failed. Asked the same counter staff again who quickly came over to help me with the passcode.

Seems that different outlets have different passcodes, and he has just transferred from another outlet. He apologised for this, but I told him it’s ok.

I found the whole experience very interesting, albeit a bit time consuming. I initially punched in my age cos I thought that’s what they needed 😂

Ordered Shack Stack (Mushrooms & Beef Burger). It was really delicious! The ale was pretty refreshing too.

It was full house when I was there at 7.15pm. I wish I have gone upstairs. Cos after reading the reviews here, upstairs has nicer environment.

Shake Shack served complimentary water (self service) at a counter where you find serviettes and condiments. One also return the trays at the same counter.

I’m impressed that the service staff cleared the trays pretty fast.

Would I visit this Bishan Junction 8 outlet again? Probably if I’m in the area again. I would def hop upstairs the next time round though."
"Great tasting food and excellent service! All the staff were so polite and efficient, it was a great dining experience here!

I loved that they have balonglong juice and it was so refreshing.

If you drive, there's a place to park right opposite the restaurant."
Staff was polite and respectful.Sourdough pizza the best.
loved their foods. We enjoyed so much of their pizza. Tasty and yummy.  Friendly staffs too like jenny and  laarnie
Father's Day Celebration was worth it here! Great tasting food!
"Was there for cny eve dinner. Glutinous rice was rather disappointing. In the small bowl, there was only 1 tiny slice of Chinese mushroom & 2 very thin slices of Chinese sausage. No garnishes at all inside. Maybe kitchen was too busy to add them? Rice was very plain without any fragrance. Told the male waiter that chef should give more ingredients and he replied that all were portioned out. Told him that was why should portion put more! Ate half of the small bowl only because rice was not nice at all. After 2 hours of the dinner I was very hungry that I got to eat the tarts they gave. Tart was a great idea and they were not bad. After that my son was also hungry. I paid $154 for both of us but did not get enough food to eat. Never like this. Sigh"
"Very nice and affordable Malaysian style tze char stall.

I came with a friend and we ordered the San Lou Bee Hoon, KL Mee and the dry curry pork dish.

San Lou Bee Hoon: Very smoky. Strong wok hei flavour. Not overcooked to the point of being charred. 5/5

KL Mee: Slightly smoky and contains a generous amount of lard which elevated the flavour. 5/5

Dried Curry Pork: Very tender pork slices covered in Chinese style curry. 4/5

Both noodle dishes cost between $6-$7. The pork dish cost $12. The prices were reasonable.

I would recommend this place to tze char lovers."
"Typical Chinese restaurant serving 四川烤鱼/Sichuan Grilled Fish in varying levels of spices & chillis. Have eaten in their other outlets at Mosque Street & Liang Seah Street before so we were fairly acquainted with the menu. Arrived for our 630pm reservation & was promptly shown to our table. Ordered within 10mins via QR scanned menu. Food/drinks were served pretty fast. Friendly service too. Overall, awesome flavours in great serving sizes."
"Price adorable, food was nice, I paid for service charge and I know it was not much but I was expecting a nicer service, I saw the sign board of “please wait to be seated” so I wait but no one even say hi, they was busy joke around with each other so I walked inside myself. I ordered beef noodle which is usually come with the condiments such as a chilli and they dont serve it until I ask, right after I finished the food I have small chit chat with my friend and someone just collect everything on our table which I found is rude. Much better if you can improve your services. Thanks.."
"Old school restaurant, famous for paper chicken. good place for gathering to taste local food. public car park behind shop. bus stop and MRT within walking distance."
"Was recommended by Howe to try Spanish food here, had an excellent dinner here at Tapas. This restaurant is conveniently located to the bridge linking to terminal 3. Foods are well presented, taste and pairing was awesome. Excellent service, excellent food! Thanks to all waiting and kitchen staff for making this happen!"
"While it's not a vegetarian restaurant, they have a decent selection of vegetarian dishes. Portions were good for the price given. Phad Thai was tasty abd the vegetarian version didn't have any egg or alliums. They also accepted our request to have a non spicy version of the vegetarian salted bean Kang Kong."
Went there as a small celebration with a group of friends. Service staff were patient and knowledgeable as it was our first time trying cheese platter. We didn’t know what to go for. Food came very fast and were really delicious.
"Samy’s curry house is indeed a local legend! The pappadums are crispy, but also a bit thicker than normal, giving good texture. For me, they’re best enjoyed crushed and scattered liberally over the mildly fragrant biryani, which won’t overpower the other flavors on the plate. The best thing on the menu, though, is easily the fish curry. A masterpiece of fusion cooking - an Indian curry bubbling away in a Chinese clay pot - its flesh is fresh, firm and clean tasting, but nevertheless permeated completely with the fragrance of spice. As some would say, all the curries here “got power one!” and your tongue will thank you after the burn!

As for the atmosphere, it’s cheap and cheerful; a casual eatery with friendly, attentive service. Not exactly the place for candle-lit dinners, but perhaps where you go with your buddies after a long business meeting for a couple of pitchers of amazing lime juice or cold beers. Unless your date is also a banana-leaf rice aficionado, in which case, go for it!"
"NOT HEIGENE,USING BARE HANDS TO SERVE COOKED FOOD"
Our regular dinning place on weekdays for economical western dishes. Like this place because they serve pork. Their porklion is tender and delicious. They also serve nice crispy rosti. Generous portion too. You can choose your own sides and also option to add as a set. You can conveniently park at Heartbeat car park if you drive.
"Location is good. Right next to a bus stop back into town.

Ambience and vibe decent. A family restaurant with a nice decor, albeit the chairs are uncomfortable.

Food was good. Chips came out old cold, burger was good thought.

Service was slow, poor staff, only one person serving the entire restaurant."
"Just tried a few dishes and found their Korean style fried chicken is not bad. They use boneless chicken and the serving is quite big. For Mala Xiang Guo, the rice and style is too dry for my liking. Will return to try the BBQ and other dishes."
"The atmosphere can feel a little bright during the day but it’s not too noisy. It can get cold with the strong aircon. The food was good, especially recommend the paella!"
"Went canton at Bedok Mall yesterday as they have the tea break promo. It was packed, waited around 5 mins to get a table. Ordered my favourite shrimp mango fritters and egg tarts! Did not disappoint. The piggy buns are my kids favourite as well, too cute to eat."
"Good food. Popular with the local crowd in Bukit Batok. Weekend mornings are crowded, you might need to wait a while if you’re unlucky."
We sat outdoors and this place has super chill vibes and good settings for family / work dinner and networking activities. good ambiance and great scene! Eitel was such a great host and he made sure our tables are always filled with food and drinks 🤟
"Literally jumped off the bus at the next stop when I saw this place and ran back. I was thrilled to eat something so authentically flavored. The Bruschettini was perfect and every pizza I saw passing my table was gorgeously designed with a perfectly crafted tomato sauce. Cozy restaurant setting overall, for solo diners and groups, with hard working and attentive staff, budget friendly menu. Would visit again!"
"The last time I visited Neon, it was more than a year ago, and I remembered being disappointed at the quality and pricing of the food.

This time, I was pleasantly surprised because it does feel like they have found the rhythm back in their stride. The food was lovely, and the cocktails, even classic ones that we ordered, were on point.

The tapas generally were very well balanced in terms of taste. The outstanding dish of the night was the amaebi served with wasabi tobiko on top of a crispy piece of chicken skin. The combination was sublime, with the freshness and sweetness of the shrimp complimenting that oily satisfying note from the chix skin.

The hamachi sashimi was fresh, served over ponzu. The bone marrow with uni was done really well, served with decadent brioche, and just the right amount of savory and sweetness. I usually worry if the uni is fresh but the uni quality was exceptional.

The duck foie gras dumplings were yunmy, only complaint is that I can’t really taste the foie, but still a satisfying dish.

The chilean seabass was perfectly cooked with bits of crispy garlic, and overall a perfect ending to the meal.

They make a really mean campari sour, and their old fashioneds weren’t shabby as well.

Overall fun environment to be in, will be back."
"Went on a weekend at 4pm and the restaurant is already half full. Queue starts at around 5pm.
Ordered beef yakiniku bowl (normal size), the sauce is quite salty for me. Gyudon should be a safer choice as it's not so salty. We were served with tea halfway through our meal.
Good price for dine in at Jewel."
"They have a huge hygiene issue. Not all plates and bowls are washed properly. I hope they really take some effort to wash. Other time I went and this time i went, the bacon isn’t fresh and I asked it to be changed and got a fresh bacon. I hope they will check the food before sending out. The food is nice but certain things are turn off as mentioned above."
"Curry puffs - most tasted about the same , not much different. Crust is crispy but very hard."
"Their set lunch starts at $15.80. Value for money, a must try. Amazing place to catch live matches. Amazing atmosphere during the World Cup 2018 matches. Opens till late."
"Definitely one of the better Spanish food restaurants here. It's my second best Spanish food restaurants here this far. The ambience is rather upmarket.

We had the Galician grilled octopus, red prawn gambas, crispy tomato bread for starters. For mains, we had the crispy suckling with strawberries and the braised pork cheek rice (photo not included). Food is flavourful yet not salty."
"Decided to try this joint after seeing a small crowd of people having their dinner here on an early Monday evening.

Overall the Garlic Pork Belly and the Lor Mee is really good. The signature bee hoon was ok, perhaps not as flavourful as one would think.

The only thing that was lackluster was the lychee sweet and sour pork which is far too floury to properly enjoy.

A decent place to try 👍🏻"
"A-Roy Thai Restaurant serves very yummy Thai food! For the yummyness, you need to pay more for it. You need to have everyone present before you are allowed to enter as there are usually buzzing with people during lunch office hours.

We had Tom yum soup, mango salad, prawn cake, spring roll, red ruby and chendol.

The Tom yum soup is not too spicy. The fish and seafood is fresh and nice. The manage salad is appetising. Peanuts and mango are crunchy. The prawn cake has a sweet sauce to go with. It's fried but not too oily. The spring roll is crispy and nice with the sweet chilli sauce. The red Ruby and chendol are not too sweet and simply delicious!"
Had an amazing dining experience thanks to Judy and Lai Yong’s exceptional hospitality! Their energy and charisma truly made our visit memorable. Highly recommend for anyone looking for top-notch service. Can’t wait to return!
"Decent Thai food with reasonable price. I personally love their fried “Kang Kong” and clear tomyam soup. Will try out other Thai dishes, green beef curry, pandan chicken, etc in the future…"
Only my 2nd time to Joo Koon outlet and very impressed with the level of service from manager Nathan and crew. I have not even experienced such service in Little India restaurants. I ordered the garlic naan and mutton and was really good. Would definitely recommend 😊👍
Cheated by their E-Fu mian.Its actually E mian and had no vegetables or mushrooms the first time they serve it.We have to return the e-fu mian twice before they bothered to give us vegetables and mushrooms.Terrible end to a cny reunion dinner
"Good food/cuisines from North of India.. 😋
Must try is their Jhinga 🦐 Maharaja with Garlic butter naans 🫓"
"Since we crossed the door, we were informed and reminded x3 times about the “last order” timing, everyone started stressing! We were x8, they proposed that we sit separated as they didn’t have a table for 8 ready!!! We fixed it for them in 2min so we could sit together! Then, when it came to taking the orders, it was a continuous back and forth and lack of ownership, I called the manager, he didn’t really care. The food was good, quality steaks and great sides! Such a pity that the crew messed up the chef and his team’s great quality work… this restaurant needs some attention from the management… good luck!"
"Today, we dined at NAE:UM and ordered the classic menu of Episode 5 with both half wine pairing and non-alcoholic pairing. I must say that everything from the service, taste, to presentation was impeccable. My favorite dish of the night was the BBQ beef dish, which was extremely juicy and flavorful. It is probably one of the best beef dishes I have had in Singapore.

What impressed me the most was the amount of thought put into pairing each drink with each dish. The pairings complemented each other perfectly. One of the staff members highly praised one of the pairing wine, Joseph Faively, and that it is his favorite wine, and I could very much see why it was his favorite.

As a cherry on top, the staff left us alone after serving us the celebration cake, which was a great touch as my companion and I enjoyed being able to enjoy our own space. The only criticism we have is that the sparkling Jasmine tea was a bit rough on the throat and not to my taste.

Overall, I came in with high expectations for NAE:UM and left very impressed with the experience."
"Utappam was ok. Chutney,  sambar was tasty.
Miscommunication in drinks order,  resolved quickly by waiter.
Gets Kind of Congested, so eat and leave."
"Food portions were HUGE and the food was delicious! Easily shared between two to three people, the jjampong had a perfect kick to it and the seafood was great. The jjajangmyeon was substantial and the sauce was tasty. Damage was about $20/pax.

There were also GREAT OPTIONS for larger groups (yukhoe/sashimi) and I’d really recommend coming here with a bigger group to taste everything… I’m a huge fan, and would happily return here."
"Its my first time visiting @westendsg at D'Arena Country Club, Upper Jurong Road! They have fitness, activities, entertainments and food for everyone! They have activities and wellness like onsen and billards too! (Easy parking with lots of lots available too!)

"We are a group of four, ordered two wagyu burger, squid ink spaghetti and grilled salmon. Food is above average and portions are reasonable. The oreo and strawberry milk shake is so good! Service is prompt but could be a bit more attentive to the needs of the patrons. Overall good experience. We will definitely come back again!"
"Enjoyable dinner!
Chai tea👍
Pani puri - pleasant taste! First time tasting it.
Mango Lassi - too sweet!"
Found this place after many years! But I must admit that I was a little disappointed. The fried balacan fish was still very good. Crispy & flavourful. Just don't look at the oil :p. Crispy baby squid was the best dish of the night. Black pepper crayfish was 😔. It's dry & quite tasteless. Deep fried fritters was expected. The rest of the dishes we ordered were nothing spectacular. Perhaps I was expecting a lot more as it was one of my favourite Tze char places many years back when they were still at Kallang. Do make a reservation if you are planning to visit. It's very popular with limited seating.
We enjoyed the Modern Singaporean cuisine at Foliage very much. Please check out my Reel and detailed caption on Instagram at @veronicaphua
"The service here is really slow and lacking. Got the outside seat. Didn’t pass the usual bag holder that they usually still pass to us at every other outlet.

When asked for menu for our parents, asked us to use QR code. Reluctantly passed one menu.

Food was ok. Refilling of water is not auto and have to get their attention. But we do see the refilling of tea. 2 dessert (pudding) took way too long to come when it is getting empty. Not sure why"
"A bit too salty,but normally good taste with reasonable price,the serving speed was a bit too slow though."
"The food was very good. Especially the crab pasta (10/10). The bread is very tasty (8/10). The pizza looked nice. Dough & crust good, overall 7.5/10. Service is very good (9.5/10), all service staff were friendly, attentive & helpful. Ambience good (7.5/10), acoustically a bit noisy.  The table setting very nice (9/10), the table cloth has a pleasant look & comfortable feel. The tiramisu cake lacks the alcohol but still scores a solid 8.5/10.  Good price value. We will be back for more delicious pasta 😋"
"Ordered Mysore Mutton (not in menu) 23SGD, but it wasn't having any spices at all, mostly filled with raw onion shallots. Totally like a bland food. Quantity is barely enough for one person, even after giving feedback, the manager doesn't care to check with customer and resolve the issue.
Ordered Masala butter milk and it was also totally not up to the mark.
Considering the premium price that they charge, their food is not acceptable, hence 1 star only. There are better restaurants around, people should try them first."
"Was looking for good food near SGH and found this place by chance. Would highly recommend to come here for a homely Vietnamese food. Below are my unbiased review:

The Lemongrass chicken skewers are really tasty, juicy and tender. The portion is also big.

Eel porridge is special and taste really nice and comfy especially in a rainy day.

Chicken Pho has a light broth that still encompass all the flavours. So if you prefer stronger taste, you might find it bland.

Fresh spring roll is fresh and good too, big in size! The sauce that comes with the spring roll is also unique and tasty.

Pork Bun Cha is a flavourful fish with fresh vegetables, sauce that is light with a tinge of sour, coupled with the pork meat patty that’s well flavoured (but a little hard for my taste).

The prawn crackers has light prawn taste and not oily, those who prefer lighter prawn taste will like this one.

For drinks, Vietnam coffee is a little light; the lemon grass is nice but is sweeten.

Service is very homely and they are Vietnamese who speaks chinese.

Would be back again for sure! Thank you for the amazing food!"
Terrible service with surly staff who kept getting a simple order wrong. The cashier is foreign (from China judging by her accent) and short changed me by $5 and when I raised it she shouted at me. Got my $5 back without so much as an apology. Food is mediocre af best. Will never patronise this place again.
"Celebrated wife's birthday and was a perfect choice! Chef and his 2 assistants were incredible, warm and highly hospitable. Felt like I was conversing with good friends and having a great dinner with excellent food together. They certainly know their stuff and celebrated my son for completing his national service by offering him shots of alcohol :) Highly recommended for special occassion made even more special by the IBID team."
I was introduced to this Singapore landmark during a recent holiday.  Such a festive atmosphere with many birthday celebrations. Great food of the highest quality. The coffee ribs were out of this world.
"This restaurant should be TOTALLY avoided for being greedy, irresponsible in repeatedly reaching Covid rules. We don’t need such restaurants in Singapore even if the food is decent."
"our second visit, very authentic thai flavour! fish cake are homemade. padthai, fried rice, tom yum is a must try!"
"A hidden gem of a place - it always feel special when you discover something by accident.  Restaurant Focal is just that - Chefs Marcus and Jonathan marry foreign ingredients and local flavours seemlessly in their offerings.  In cosmopolitan Singapore where you can find every conceivable cuisine there is, the flavours you experience in Restaurant Focal is different and refreshing."
"120124 lunch $6 / A very good bowl of Fish Head Bee Hoon. Was a little concerned of fishiness because the batang fish head was not fried kind... turns out pretty tasty with lots of vege.  Finished up everything.
They have other different fishes head n of course,  prices varies.
Might have extra MSG in the soup though because i can feel my face tightening...."
One of my favorite places to eat and have a beer on a random day. Indian food at Barrels is pretty good and at a decent price. Also there’s always happy hour / promotions like Guinness pints for 10 SGD on Thursday’s. Staff is friendly as well. Very recommended.
"What a food!! I’m in awe.. The roast chicken with mashed potato and cranberry sauce is the bomb! Mushroom
Risotto And everything else are taste so great as well. The most important, its already Halal. Will be back here for sure."
"Beautiful location. Great staff.

Ordered the Italian Pork Sausage, it was excellent.  First time I’ve had an airy thin crust pizza.  The sauce was also semi-sweet and not as tangy as most place in Singapore.

Will definitely come back."
"Relatively new kid on the block. Decided to give it a try and I think one of the bosses was very friendly and courteous to the diners and was really making sure the diners enjoyed the food.
Quite crowded on a weekend morning even when it just opened for the day. Ordered the small prawn noodles, big prawn noodles and the big prawns zuke. Also had the prawn roll and the fried tofu.
The starters selection was very limited to only 4 items, would hope they can expand the selection someday. The mains serving was quite generous, and also like many have mentioned it's more on the expensive side. The broth is different from the prawn noodles and the prawn zuke, the prawn noodles broth had the pork ribs flavour as well while the prawn zuke was purely prawn broth which I enjoyed more. The serving for the broth in the little teapot was not a lot, and the staff came to give me another refill which was then just sufficient for the dish. Was a wise move using short rice also, making the dish very tasty.
I personally liked the fried tofu but the prawn roll was nothing to shout about. I guess the portion is quite big so I don't see people ordering loklok.
Good broth and good experience."
Truly enjoy the food and experience.  Every dish is cooked to perfection and the crayfish kway teow is out of this world.
Here for company lunch so no concept of the price here pls ignore my spending. Food is decent. Spread is kind of limited but sufficient.
I ordered the set lunch. Mushroom soup was nice and smooth. The pork burger had a big portion and good. The meat was not dry and not fatty.
"We had a lunch in one Saturday afternoon after I tried sticky rice here. I was so disappointed that I ordered Thai curry chicken. The color is white and not green at all, suggest too much coconut pulp and too less basil and chili. Chicken also taste weirdly crunchy that I’v never anticipated. I wonder how it be prepared or maybe it was just artificial meat? The Thai basil rice, pineapple fried rice, and tong yam fried rice are ok, hawker center level."
"Interesting location. Near Stevens MRT.
Place is very small - suggest to make a reservation.
The pasta is good! And my order came with nice big juicy prawns.
Pizza please eat when warm! Else the taste not so nice. :)
Nice ambience, very homely and warm place"
"A place with good steak, super Laksa, special Hoo-ha's beer for music lovers. Jam session with the owner and other musicians"
The thai and economic rice here are really good!! And I love the teh bing here
"overall service was okay, dining environment  was pleasant too. however, the ""heart attack"" pizza was lacking of flavour and in my opinion is slightly overpriced. mineral water was sold per bottle and was not really reasonably priced. nonetheless, the dining experience was somewhat pleasant other than the slightly pricey items..."
"My go-to place for delicious crispy prata!

Their Coin Prata was well fried with a good amount of crisp. I usually go for the mutton option but decided to try the chicken which was equally good, although much lesser meat.

The Masala Dosa was served with a generous amount of aloo potato and went really well with the sauces - well worth the $3.50.

I always order my favourite egg onion prata and to my pleasant surprise the egg yolk came slightly runny today! Damn good I hope they make it like this every time. The fish curry and sambal are good as usual.

Looking forward to my next visit already 😋"
"Been here quite a number of times, the fish in Japanese grilled is my first try and I immediately name it as my favourite dish!  Seafood pasta is disappointing, too salty, and risotto was not as expected, not enough taste, suspect the chef accidentally put the salt for risotto to the seafood pasta :p

Nevertheless overall the seafood range is always good and never disappoint! W love the umeshu jelly as well! Thank you for the service team that make up our good experience!"
The chicken soup and the dried chilli mushroom are nice and special itself.
"Update: 18 Dec 23, Lunch:
Celebrated my 59th Birthday, the sashimi plate was really value for money, so fresh and thick pieces. Service was great! Keep it up!! 😊

23 Nov 23: Thanksgiving Dinner:
It was a surprisingly good value for money Thanksgiving dinner.. 😋"
"We order beef horfun and sin chow bee hoon. Salty gravy and beef tasted slimy. Bee hoon pathetic few bean sprouts and egg, tasted like rubber so bad we didn't finished! Total rip off at $5 per plate!"
"Seeing the steak restaurant next door priced at 32.9 dollars, I immediately decided to dine at Crystal Jade.

A bowl of hot noodle soup must be the warmest treat for passengers traveling on planes or connecting flights. For diners who don't eat pork, you can order the beef brisket noodles and shrimp dumplings.

🥩Beef Brisket Noodles
The soup base is reasonably rich, without any surprises, in a typical Chinese culinary style. The beef and brisket pieces are quite large, making it more satisfying than scallion oil noodles.

🥩Shrimp Dumplings
These are large shrimp dumplings, following the Cantonese style. The dumplings are a bit dry, suitable for quick meals.

🥩Bamboo Shoots
This seems to be a specialty side dish at Jade Kitchen, ordered by almost every table. However, it has a peculiar taste, with too much sugar, resulting in less saltiness. It's the kind of dish where you can feel a novice chef trying hard to cook, but no matter what, they can't achieve a consistent and flavorful seasoning. However, when eaten with the rich soup-based noodles, it creates a unique combination. It's a magical dish and a specialty of this restaurant. But at 8.8 bucks
the price seems a bit high, considering you get only a small portion of bamboo shoots, around 100g.

If you only eat the noodles, it might offer better value for money. Overall, it's not a disappointing choice."
"Had the Set Menu A @ SGD195++ All dishes were very tasty. Ambience was nice. Most outstanding was service by Emilia. Just the right balance of attentiveness, professionalism and friendliness."
the food before peak hours taste good the service was amazing too it is peaceful too
"This evening I enjoyed a North Indian veggie set meal with Onion Pakoda. My wife enjoyed a big Masala Dosa.

Everything was tasty and good portions.

Service was efficient and friendly.

A place I will surely revisit 😋"
"Delicious meals, great prices, and friendly service staff.
We will be back again.
Highly recommended"
"The Dish is super power, I love thier masala chicken and chicken kurma. Should give credit to the chef Mr Ramesh. Super Power"
Prata always solid but ordered fish and chips after awhile and this is what I got so ask for the size of the fish they’re gonna cook you first. Finished fish in 3 bites but taste good also
"Catch up with friends in Saturday evening. The staffs are friendly though we just walk in without reservation but they accommodate us in just fine while other customer hasn't arrived, that's the spirit.

We were served immediately by the waiters walking us through menu and recommendation, that is really warmth service. We had the house courses and herbs chicken along with juices and of course, a latte for myself.

Had a great time spending there chit chat with friends and we can see the restaurant is actually full house. The waiters keep doing rounds to serve us water to keep us comfort, kudos to that! Keep up the great work and the services!"
"10.11.23 / $14 range / weekdays 30m to 5pm promo.... prices starts from $9.90.++.. had the beef (with spicy sour vege),  so pay extra $2... comes with free sides n a drink.... the protion was too huge for me.. nice meal though, n I especially loved the spicy soup... yummy.."
"It’s Korean Fusion so do not expect the traditional menu. Food presentation is definitely fine dining style. “Anju”means food that goes with drinks (alcohol) so was hoping for similar Izakaya dinner. But the 2seating timing limit, we could only hastily finish a bottle of soju and return the table."
"Very disappointing, quality is worse than hawker center and staff not very happy to serve. Ordered a simple rice meal with 2 curries and a veg, plus mutton. The mutton is so hard to bite that I need to ask them for a knife to cut the meat out from the bone. Better go across the road to pasir pajang food centre."
"An amazing restaurant.  Great food, cool atmosphere.  Service is good and efficient.  The restaurant is open only for members and their friends."
"One of my favorite supper spots. Hidden in a secluded corner of this neighborhood, you can enjoy great quality food and drinks in a cozy manner (as long as you get the outdoor seats). Prata is made soft and fluffy, while the curry has the kick. Ice milo is also to die for."
"The white noodle is indeed tasty.
But, overall can be pricy for a meal of 4 simple dishes.
I find the bitter gourd omelette a little overcook though. Still prefer the egg to be a bit runny type 😋"
Can not forgetful about this restaurant’ “Wang Bu Liao “ Fish. What a nice fish I ever eat. It is Very fresh and delicious.
I’m usually very blur so aunties always scold me. But the auntie here never scold me. NICE AUNTIE!!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"Highly recommend this place for wedding for small (70-100)pax weddings. We had our wedding here in July and it was great!

Food: The restaurant allowed us to customise our own menu. All the dishes on the actual day were luxurious and delicious. The portions were generous and the presentation of the dishes were a feast for the eyes. Our guests loved the food!

Cost: The cost per head of S$150++ was really worth it for the quality and quantity of our seven course meal. The minimum spend required for booking the whole venue is also a reasonably achievable amount for a small wedding.

Coordination: The floor manager Doris Wong was helpful, accommodating, and kind. She helped us iron out many stressful hiccups before and during the wedding, and we are really grateful for her to help to create a smooth-sailing night.

Flexibility: The venue allowed us to rent our own sound system, set up a band, and do our own decorations."
"Food is average . The beef cheeks is gamey , thankfully there is potato mash to help cover its taste . Next time I will just order their fish and chips instead. I couldn’t finished the cheese cake as it is not nice . The students inside tries their best to serve you inside the cafe but they forgot to serve me my coffee when my desert comes . The manager did apologise when he realise that they did not serve me the coffee which I ordered . Keep up the good work students 💪🏻 price is reasonable for set lunch with soup , main dish , desert and coffee ."
"Was at Swensen's West Mall for dinner this evening. Tried redeeming my birthday evouchers, and Cathy was very patient in explaining the redemption process to me. Throughout the dinner, I noticed that Cathy was very diligent, and was attentive & provided good customer service to the diners. Food was also served fresh and fast. Overall was a great dinning experience and will visit again!"
"We tried the Wanzhou Old School Grilled fish and the Grandma braised meat. Both dishes super wonderful. Really nice. For the grilled fish, they pour a small glass of liquor to it and the light it up for the extra flavor. The chili that goes with the braised meat was nicely blended and really help to complement the meat and bring out the flavor without overpowering it. Nicely done!"
"Since they have new menu in Q3 2023, I finally visited the place. Better food quality, improved service. My friend and I really like it. Will definitely returned again."
First and last time. The $13 bowl of fish (including service charge) soup is half the size of a normal bowl and the armount of fish is equivalent to 2 slices of what you'll normally get in other places.
"Ordered the dinner set, price was worth the portion.
Mango salad was so fresh but could have had more dressing.
Crab cake was delicious, one of the better ones we had.
Steak we ordered medium rare and perfectly cooked it came.
It was my wife’s birthday and I told the service staff Praba at the last minute and he still was able to make arrangements. Really thankful for him going the extra mile."
