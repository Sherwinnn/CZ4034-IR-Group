"Food is generally good. Serving size on the small end. Mutton, bind and palak paneer are good.  Butter chicken is a bit too sweet.  Naan is a bit thin, thus butter Naan feels oily throughout.  Gulab Jamun is dry and flaky for the first serving but the second serving was normal. So, quality is not consistent. Mango lassi is also small and overpriced.  Pricing comparable to other Indian restaurant. Waiter is attentive.

Parking gantry does not work properly.  We used various cards including nets, flash pay etc.  In the end need to use Paynow. Lol."
"My friend and I are post duty from work and decided to eat somthing before we head home. So we went to Sakura in this Eastpoint Mall.

The service wise is not I can recommend, I think they needed a workshop or attend a course for customer service. The staff is lazy to walk towards to the customer that wanted to order. And I was shock that the spoon and fork are not de same design ( it is understandable if you are doing it at home )

As seen on the pictures, no presentation on the fried squid and sauce, and to mention so hard to eat, and the sambal kangkong, was a lousy appearance."
"Their food is tasty and affordable. We ordered their green curry, tom yum clear seafood, prawn omelette, nonya fried fish and prawn cakes. The standouts for me were the omelette, seafood soup and green curry. The portion were generous for that price so I have nothing to complain about. However I don't recommend their drinks. We order the Thai milk tea, green milk tea and the red ruby drink. Too much sugar but not enough body. Not enough milk I think and I am not sure what else but its really not to my liking. So just order the food and drink the soup and leave the drinks alone unless you are ordering the can drink variety."
"A Mixed Experience at Tapas Club: Delectable Cuisine with Premium Pricing.

My visit to Tapas Club offered a culinary journey through their menu of Spanish delicacies. The Seafood and Chicken Paella impressed with its moist rice, each grain infused with the rich essence of the ocean. Equally noteworthy were the Pulled Pork Tacos, featuring meat so tender it melted in the mouth, and the Mediterranean Salad, which was a beacon of freshness.

However, despite the high-quality food, the prices at Tapas Club are on the higher end. The cost is a significant factor to consider, especially when comparable Spanish cuisine might be found elsewhere at a more affordable rate.

Given the sparse customer turnout during a weekday lunch, it does raise the question of whether Tapas Club might review their pricing strategy to enhance their appeal, especially if they wish to draw a larger crowd during typically slower business hours."
Average taste with affordable price. Overall good.
"Food was decent, flavourful enough and service is welcoming. Like the glazed pork, split wings and fried rice‚Ä¶ e sarn Thai has been there for the longest time and the taste didn‚Äôt change. Will still recommend people to go & try"
"Came here on a Monday at 9pm after my gym session. All the other restaurants were closing. The staff were friendly and my drink order was served very fast. My order of sausage and baked potato took a while but it was worth it.

I ordered a Beer-ga-rita cos I wanted a cocktail but it was Oktoberfest so I decided to have a combo of both. Overall a chill place to hang out with friends and family."
"Expensive for the food we received. My friends and I dined at Don Dae Bak and decided to order the cold noodles and beef noodles, alongside several side dishes. The portions were meagre and all 3 of us ended up getting food poisoning. The only saving grace was the service staff who were polite and ready to serve us."
"At first glance, your typical Zi char stall in your neighborhood kopitiam. That is until you see the menu with dishes not commonly found in other Zi char places. The crispy chicken in the picture is an extremely difficult dish to find and it's execution was perfect. Now if only it wasn't so expensive, I could have it every week"
"The cheese prata is very good. There are tower of ice teh tarik which is what I'd never seen before. One can taste the cheese, a bit salty to my liking.

Also ordered horlicks which is just as good if not better. Not too sweet and not too bland. One of the best horlicks I'd drunk. Definitely will come back again if I'm nearby.

Parking is an issue, but given that it is open 24 hours, if you come at midnight, you can just park along the roadside which most others did.

It's Sunday 2:08am and the place is full of people. Probably due to Christmas holiday tomorrow. Will definitely bring my family over though I live in the North East."
"Born restaurant by Chef Zor Tan is a culinary masterpiece that seamlessly blends French and Asian influences. The high-quality food and impeccable service create a dining experience that transcends the ordinary. Each dish is a canvas of flavors, with every ingredient contributing to a rich tapestry of memories. The thoughtful interior design adds to the overall ambiance, making it a feast for the senses. After multiple visits, I am eager to return, captivated by the delightful journey that Born offers."
"One of my faves hawkers. Aside from being by the seaside, most stalls have great food. Very yum! Haven't eaten anything that's not yummy here. Faves are Duck Rice, Crispy roast pork, popiah and lime juice. Great to eat also around 4pm and sit on the side by the beach, its calming."
"Went on a weekend dinner time, crowd started streaming in around 6-7pm, but there were still enough seats. Seem like the restaurant is managed by 2 staff + a chef (?) but still very efficient.

Ordered the Squid+pork belly hotplate, tofu kimchi stew and, rice cake (tteokbokki). Personally not a fan of the pork belly as it has a gamey taste, as do many pork belly in other places. The tofu stew was nice and homey. The rice cake dish was special, the sauce seemed different from others I have had. The rice cake also had a good bounce to it, but remained adequately soft. We were also given free flow side dishes. Enjoyed the potato salad very much!

All in all, 3.5 stars!"
"Liu Sha Pau was not ""flowy"" at all and some of the food tasted a bit stale."
"Been here quite a few times. And the food is consistently good. Recommend the ayam buah keluak, beef rendang, dry laksa noodles. For kids, the nasi goreng (non spicy) is a good choice! I also enjoyed the pulut Hitam!

Service wise, nothing short of stellar. Every time I‚Äôm here, Ann gives good recommendations on food choices. However, today in particular, I brought the family (including a newborn baby) and Ann was particularly attentive and considerate to our needs. She even made special arrangements for my baby boy. Such staff should be recognized and I hope the management can note her performance accordingly!

Good food, family friendly. Highly recommend."
"One of the best restaurants i have ever been. The view is marvelous, the food is good and the staff is very nice... Just do your prior reservation and things will be good for you! A must visit place if you in Singapore. The property is well maintained and food is nice... Their 20 layer cake is a bit hyped but thier other desserts are really good and yummy..."
Pretty decent food.
"Am a regular here. Best Nasi Goreng Kampong in town. Fast service, good food. Price ain't exactly cheap but pretty affordable. Vocado milk shake used to be good, but no longer so."
Love the top quality and selection of beef and others including the prawns as well as the sides. Must say the beef was super just on its own alto sauces and sea salt was available. Liked the bipimbap and kimchi as well as the salads and cucumbers. Macha ice cream tops the ending. Good for families with teens and kids!!
"Good Taiwanese food at very reasonable prices.

Portion sizes are large, so two people can comfortably share most dishes, unless both are very hungry!

The restaurant has a quiet and cosy atmosphere on weekday afternoons, but gets busy at dinner time.

Service staff are attentive, friendly and very efficient."
"Nice and tasty food. If you love spicy, come here!! Fish is so fresh that it went so well with the rice. Though the quality of rice can be improved.

I called before hand to book a table and the waitress was very nice to assist a last minute booking.

The Lala was not great a rather expensive so can skip. Vegetable wasn‚Äôt nice too.

As we order whole fish, sweet sour pork (super nice) and a few other dishes, we could not try the skewers. Will be back to try them."
Lea and raszy and Haikal was awesome made us feel like family. Even though first time here.  Service was amazing !
Maybe ok for Sentosa but compared to mainland Japanese restaurants Syun is not exactly fine dining. They have some strange variations. Eg adding foie gras and butter to Unagi. Totally covered the original taste of Unagi. And they added a lime. Who does that ! The wagyu set is the most expensive for lunch. The wagyu is hardly marbled and came out cold which is terrible. The dessert is the best. Nice portions of strawberry mangos and a red bean pastry.
Throwback august 2023. We reached rather late almost like 45min before their closing time. But they‚Äôre still very welcoming. Burger was huge and worth the price. I had mine Build My Own Burger üçî!!! Yummy ü§§
"We really like meat balls, chicken wings and the mushroom soup at IKEA restaurant. Membership of IKEA family has one free kopi every day. The dining experience her is always great."
"Visited the Holland V branch for my family‚Äôs first meal on 1 Jan 2024 and as regular patrons of soup restaurant for many years, we were sorely disappointed by this branch‚Äôs poor service. The waitress made snide remarks when my mum asked for a sip of tea and said that she will not be able to refill the tea if it was shared. Really terrible service, and the food quality seems to have deteriorated too. Altogether an unpleasant experience for my family."
Good food at reasonable prices. We were offered a special slice of birthday cake for my son. Sirloin steak was soft and delicious.
"One of the restaurant that wasn't crazy when I went during dinner hours. Appreciate the great hospitality.  Took the 2 pax set meals which consist of a main - I chose the egg fried rice, sambal sweet potato leaves, 2 individual soups, chicken and dessert.

Egg fried rice was a little bland and oily in my books. Thankfully there's sambal. Sweet potato leave was on point.

Need to mentioned that the staffs are nice enough to top up my ginger for the chicken. Service rendered was also awesome."
Came here with company for CNY lunch. Buffet style. Not bad. Their service is good. Food tastes not bad. Price is affordable too. Will be back again another time.
"We ordered steamed fish and kong Bak pau for our lunch. Both dishes were excellent.

I enjoyed viewing the framed pictures on the walls of the restaurant.

Nice and clean toilets - love the hand soap provided."
"Highly recommended!!! Because they are 5Gs!  Great taste, Great value, Great variety, Great hours (one of the store that closes later than the others), and even Greater service, where the team is always serving with a huge smile. üòÅüòÅüòÅ Do continue to serve great food, coupled with great service! üëçüëçüëç"
"Made a self collection order, upon arrival one particular chinese guy(phd staff) approached me in a very rude way asking 'waiting for what'. Your staff needs to be send for customer service courses. After reaching home found that my pizza wasnt fully cook and best thing my garlic bread wasnt even placed in the oven, its just like eating garlic spread on a bread. Will never order from this outlet anymore."
"It's a nice place to chill with friends, The price is reasonable and the atmosphere is good. Can play darts , keep up the good work n good food. Cheers"
"Delicious mee rebus. The gravy is most probably seasoned with either ikan bilis or udang geragau, you can taste a hint of it. One of my mum's fav mee rebus stall. Nasi rawon and jenganan are also good. Expect some queueing in the morning."
Laksa is above average . Gravy is well blended with herbs . Chicken wings are crispy .
"Not efficient.  Ordered 2 lattes and corn cup waited for 20mins.
Coffee : substandard.  No coffee aroma more like milk drink."
"It was a pleasant experience at the restaurant, the waiters are very friendly and the food was above expectations.
The price is affordable and the speed of the dishes was very fast too.
My wife & sister in law was Impress with their Kimchi & I really love their Pancake."
"One of the best, if not the best, restaurant and the food was tasty and good. The manager, Owen, was very accommodating and friendly. Definitely a must go restaurant if you are around the area and needed a dinner for a large group.
Price is also very competitive."
"The most horrible and pathetic Korean bbq I ever had! Portion is pathetic for 4pax at $148. Service horrendous. Restaurant is only 3 tables occupied during visit. We have to chase for cups, water, sauce, vegetable wrap! What a first meal out for 2024!"
Amazing platter of Yu Sheng even after bringing back it home
"This place serves up yummy bancan made fresh daily!
I didn‚Äôt have much expectation on this place. But i was left satisfied.
Would definitely come back for their"
"Queued for over an hour at 6.30PM. But food was so worth it.  Padthai is sweet and savory, the crab omellete was so good. I can just eat rice with that omelette alone and be happy. Brings back childhood memories of simple yummy food. Tomyum was just okay, but still yummy. Could be more flavorful tho. Service was efficient. Will definitely come back for more omellete

Update : came back for more omellete and Pad thai for lunch. No queue this time.  Dry Green curry chicken was sooo yummy but too much skin and fat imo."
"The service staffs are very friendly and nice! Foods served fast and tasted great! Visited this outlet many times and is really good. Do note the restaurant has limited seats, so do come early during the meals time."
"Another one of my checklist to visit. We ordered the murtabak, fried chicken and fried chicken nasi lemak.

Foots was okay, the curries provided, fish and the dhal were the stars.  What really made the experience good was the patient and courteous Nature of the folks serving in this place.  I am pleasantly surprised with such manners and patience. üëçüòä"
"we enjoyed the claypot pork belly with salted fish ($16.80++) which was very flavourful and perfect with rice! mala vegetables also had a good spicy kick. a little pricey and average ambience and interior, but a tasty meal!"
Pleasant encounter! Good Masala dosa at reasonable price.
"The food is nice and affordable, but I saw hair on my food üòÇ their staffs should use hairnet tho. Only 2 star from me üòÖ"
"Pleasantly surprised with the food here. The food is so good and flavorful. The staff are very accomodating. There's a lot in their menu, so it is best to bring someone familiar with the cuisine or can ask the staff for recommendations. They are mostly known for their skewers but their cooked dishes are also great!"
"Awesome Thai food here and the long Q proves it. They don‚Äôt take reservation so have to be there early or be prepared to wait. Quality of food was top notch and definitely good value for the price. Crab Omelette was exceptional, as was the Tom Yum Goong and Pandan Chicken. Service was quite quick and attentive."
Pricey but you get high quality food and great service. They have a good selection but not overwhelming. Try the noodles and the xiao long bao. Go for the Sichuan spicy wonton in red oil. They are a must try.
"Selling curry chicken noodle but no potatoes. Upon asking. Staff said that doesn't comes with potatoes. Funny thing is that the picture shows come with potatoes ü•î lol. If you don't have any more potatoes just say so earlier when the customer is ordering. Spoils the entire experience. Comes with 3 miserable piece of chicken and 2 thin Taopok slice. Slow claps.... don't waste your time here, even the roast pork seems to look good. Don't even want to try it anymore."
This was the first time I went back to this restaurant in 2 years to give it another chance after finding a rice weevil worm in their rice. This time I tried to avoid the rice and got butter chicken and prata but still found 2 larvae in my food. I found 2 and stopped eating and threw the food away so there is a chance there were more larvae in my food too. Safe to say I will not be returning for a third time.
"Kudos to the New staff Patrick. At Westgate branch. He served us today. 23rd Feb, evening dinner.He was diligent to serve us. I signalled to another waiter but he ignored me. But Patrick saw us from behind and came to our attention. The other waiter seem to not care for our service. So I appreciate Patrick's attention to us that evening. Keep it up"
"An extraordinary Japanese restaurant close to our hearts. The seafood is impeccably fresh, and you absolutely must indulge in their grilled hamachi and succulent oysters."
"We went to Canton Paradise bedok mall on a weekday afternoon to take advantage of their 40% off promotion for dim sum and noodles. However, we were frustrated by the service and the waiting time. The restaurant was very crowded with a very loud elderly crowd and the wait staff were slow and inattentive. I had to wait for more than 20 minutes to get my food. The only redeeming factor was that the food was yummy. The dim sum was fresh and juicy, and the noodles was authentically 'Hong Kong' and flavorful.  We enjoyed the food, but not so much the experience. This particular outlet needs to improve their service and efficiency, especially during peak hours."
"The waiter got the wrong order (without even writing it down -  apparently, he did try to offer with another item when he was taking order, but i wasn't aware of it, nor did i recall any explanation why it was swapped).
Drinks somehow took longer to come out (we ordered coffee and chocolate, which should've been easy enough since it's just using coffee machine).
Bill somehow also took a while to get processed; i had to walk over and ask again for it, so that i can make the payment.

On another note, the pizza is pretty decent."
"This is the best vegetarian restaurant I‚Äôve ever been to. The vegetarian food don‚Äôt taste like vegetarian at all!

We ordered some dishes. Here are a few that I found exceptional.
1) fish: it doesn‚Äôt taste like the typical mock meat that you eat outside and the texture really taste as if it‚Äôs like a real fish, although the ingredient is tofu (I think).
2) fried yam with sweet: this dessert is presented very well, comes with dry ice (see attached photo). Not too sweet. When I bite it, the outer crust was hard but the inner yam was piping hot. The balance between hot and cold was awesome!
3) truffle olive fried rice: very well done, like zichar style."
"Carol was friendly and assist with my orders.
Service was exceptional
The staffs service was great, changing of plates was prompt and our tea was refilled several times.
The food was delicious and the ambiance was great."
"Had their Chinese New Year Menu, all of us enjoyed the food.
Service was good. They called multiple time to ensure reservations and requirements needed."
Made a reservation on Thursday for a dinner with my family of 4 last night. The gentleman who served us was polite and immediately addressed me when we walked in. Good sincere service! The food was fresh & yummy & price was very reasonable at $9.90++. The soup was a tad salty but my kid liked it. üòäwill come by again. Thanks.
The signature fried rice is good. The restaurant has limited tables and typically not adequate staff.
Amazing food and price. Im a regular there. Some of the comments are blatant lies. Come and try for yourself - you'll be a regular diner.
"Very small place. No reservations allowed. Fast and great service. Food is really good. Small menu but good quality. Garlic fried rice was good, beef tongue is interesting, rest was also good"
We were here to celebrate a friend‚Äôs birthday. They have 2 dining sessions for dinner. One at 6pm and the other at 8pm. Advance reservation will be needed as it‚Äôs usually booked out. We dined in the upper level. Love the design. We were hosted by raj who did an excellent job. He recommended us dishes and describe the portion size. Menu seems fusion but I feel like the dishes got abit lost in the fusion. My favourite dish was the buckweed noodles. The food was well cooked and season but my biggest let down was the pork rib biryani. Rice was dry and proportions of spice and nuts were not right. I like the idea but maybe could have been executed a little better for the price.
"Had my first try back in july.
Steam chicken was good with room for improvements.
Vege was delicious.
Drinks are good for the after meal.
Service was kinda okay, prompt.
Environment gave a nostalgic feel.
Will come back again soon for the roast chickenüëç"
This is my 2nd visit to Super Thai. I love how traditional and tasty their food taste and they are rather generous with the food portions. Food didn‚Äôt take long to serve as well. If you‚Äôre there you got to try their lemongrass drink as well! üòâ
"Celebrity chef is real, all dishes are tasty! We didn‚Äôt order ÂØøÊ°É , they probably overheard we were there for birthday celebration and gave us FOC! ËôæÊû£, grilled pork rib, Âπ≤ÁÖéËôæ prawn are highly recommended! ÈïøÂØøÈù¢ also very tasty, full of seafood, including big prawn, scallops, sliced fish, quail eggs etc. They will recommend dishes based on fresh ingredients they can get during your visit, for us, it‚Äôs the squid ü¶ë , real fresh and tasty! Their dishes are not cheap, still I will visit again because real tasty! High recommended for you!!!"
"Review for South Indian Thali (take-away):
Average taste
1 drink included (I took buttermilk which was good).
Quantity of rice is a lot but quantity of other items like vegetables and sambar is very less (like 2-3 spoons). Was left with plain rice to eat in the end.
Also, the display menu is confusing, with prices not mentioned.
For the cost, I would not visit again."
"Yummy and affordable western in Jewel Changi Airport.

‚ú®Chargrilled Chicken Chop @ $11.90
Well marinated chicken chop which was grilled to give a crispy exterior but tender and flavourful interior topped with your choice of black pepper or teriyaki sauce. Dish came with a side of al dente aglio olio pasta as well as a citrus salad.

‚ú® must trys!!
‚úâÔ∏è follow me @BrieVco on Instagram, TikTok and YouTube for more!"
"Their fried food are quite good. However their sushi are not very fresh. Servers are very friendly. Another downside is that there are birds flying to the tables and kitchen where they prepare the food, making it quite unsanitary and the service crew seem unfazed by them. Weirdly, don‚Äôt see this issue at the neighbouring restaurants.

Aburi salmon maki - not very fresh, can skip

Fish and chip - they use catfish making it very soft and have the melt in the mouth effect. The batter they use for both the fries and fish are very crispy

Calamari - squid they use are very fresh and soft, batter is crispy and not sharp"
"Took their set lunch! Ultra worth, cozy, a little dark but if you are up for that ambience it's a yes! Very attentive servers as well."
"Fantastic Food , enjoyed their lamb shank briyani, Chicken Briyani, Mutton Haleem. This is our spot for all lunch parties with our colleagues. I shouldn't forget to mention about the deserts Kulfi and Mango Lassi. Great hospitality , and always enjoyed the special attention. Also enjoyed the evening snacks many times , enjoyed the chat items ( which I used to take away to home as well), Masala Chai is best one which I must mention specially.
Office location is going to change and will miss this great food. But I am sure we will  come here whenever possible, and I strongly recommend this place for the tasty food lovers."
First time try food from this restaurant. Ordered a few dishes to share with my family.  All dishes are good. I will come back for the mala beehoon. üòâ
"Very friendly service, huge portion, price is very well reasonable and a WIDE variety of food with different cuisine. Although may seems like an ulu place, it will be worth travelling for their food. Addictive!"
"Pretty authentic sichuan China food. I felt that the food is not spicy enough and a tad too oily , but overall pretty decent. Portions can be bigger for the price"
"If I can give 0 star I would, Service was the worst. Asking for paynow no response and blaming on us because we change from cash payment to paynow. Second thing asking for 2 plates and scold me by saying you order 2 menu only for 3 pax can only take one plates ‚Äòso many dish to wash, nowadays water is so expensive‚Äô OMG. Food way too overrated. Please don‚Äôt even bother to come here waste time and effort. Sim Lim one is so much better."
"As with Tras street, the eateries are in abundance within the area and over here, the nice restaurants are tucked amongst the shop houses.

It was a business lunch and we went for their omakase set lunch and the chef chooses what to serve based on the pricing. We had the $208 set. Needless to say, it‚Äôs worth every penny. Every dish will be easily 8/10. We were served 6-7 dishes and you will be well fed as I was worried having to do another round of ramen along Tanjong Pagar after this session. :)

One of the highlights will be the uni that‚Äôs generously perched on the pastry puff and the caviar too.

The tuna carpaccio was decent but didn‚Äôt shine as there are two more dishes that stood out - Japanese promfret and the A4 striploin. The promfret melts in your mouth with a strong seafoody taste that anybody will die for if you‚Äôre a seafoodie.

I couldn‚Äôt remember all the sauces and condiments that accompanied all the dishes. Just too many details but they tasted wonderful and complemented each dish just so aptly.

The dessert was a panna cotta with wild berries."
"Date of visit : Sun 19 Nov 2023
Time : 1 pm

Celebrated my mum‚Äôs 94th birthday here. 12 of us. Preordered suckling pig and the birthday buns.

Ordered 8 dishes : 7 dishes + 1 dessert.
The suckling pig is excellent.
Fried mian xian, yam ring and roast chicken also good.
The fried watercress, Â§ßËèú the dessert yam paste orh nee soso.

Date of visit : Sat 21 Jan 2023
Time : 6 pm

Came here again to celebrate CNY. Restaurant‚Äôs really packed to the brim, people in joyous mood.

We ordered the $738+ menu. Started with lohei as usual. The 2nd dish fish maw soup came a bit late, about 30 mins later. So everything else was being delayed.

Also a bit disorganized as tables were not grouped by type of chosen menu, so staff at times didn‚Äôt know which table to serve.

Clearly not enough manpower and staff was busy.

Roast chicken was good. Braised mushroom with spinach too and the red bean sesame ball dessert.
Steamed grouper was soso.

Date of visit : Sun 30 Oct 2022
Time : 12.45 pm

Reserved a table for 12 in advance as my mum wanted to celebrate her 93th birthday here. The whole place seemed full.

Called ahead also to order a big pomfret about 1 kg+ and also the longevity buns - a pack of 18 costing about $40.

The longevity buns look beautiful. We are reminded not to consume the big bun nor the small teeny weeny apple like decoration buns.

Service is good : some dishes are divided into equal portions for us.

The Teochew style steamed pomfret lacks the same flavor as other Teochew restaurants. The deep fried oyster omelette is so thin and crispy that it‚Äôs unlike those sold at hawker centres.

A traditional restaurant with her loyal customers and above average food standards."
Thoroughly enjoyed the boneless mutton and spinach lentil dish. A must try if you‚Äôre in the area.
Cheap and good food. Regular lunch place with colleagues. Good for large groups
OMG! THE WORST EXPERIENCED I EVER HAD! ASKED THE AUNTY NICELY IF BITTERGOURD SLICED FISH NOODLE IS AVAILABLE AND SHE SUDDENLY RAISED HER VOICE AND TOLD ME THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE BITTERGOURD! ALL THE WAY SHE SHOUTED AT ME WHEN I'M HANDLING MY BABY SON ON THE OTHER HAND! NOT TO SURE IF ITS ME OR SHE IS HAVING A BAD DAY. FIRST AND THE LAST TO EVER BUY MY DINNER THERE!
"This place is easily missable, walked one whole round of level 1 and didnt notice I passed by it... its ridiculous how its camouflaged by the other stores.

Not a conducive place to chat while eating as the waiters keep clanging the cutlery when keeping the dishes and the sound just reverbs throughout the restaurant.

Would like to comment how funny it was their soup bowl is even smaller than their rice bowl, which was already small enough, about the size of a petit woman's  palm. How do you expect people to drink from the bowls with ingredients in it?

White rice was so little, served in a small lil tiny bowl.
Ordered their 2 pax chicken set on the front of the menu thinking its their signature dish but the chicken and the cucumber are horrible. Not fresh and super dry. It was 35++ for that chicken and soup. Not worth it. Paid 77 for 2 pax for the whole dinner (included an extra tray of siew mai and fried fish)

At the end noticed people only come here for the dimsum. But there are better dimsums out there."
"Came here for dinner with family. It was located in a coffee shop and most patron that time were eating from here.

The service was good and the food were above average. The cai pu toufu was good imo."
What the point of fan if you did not on it
"The best pratas in Singapore

Alot of innovative ideas for fusion pratas.

Tried a whole-meal prata the last visit.

Pratas are also crispy and good sized.

The Fish curry is also fantastic. Rich, creamy and free-flow !"
"Place was noisy & vibrant.
Food is relatively good. Chendol was solid! However the Crispy Garlic Chicken was a letdown.
Nasi Lemak is above average,  Penang Kway Teow, fish maw soup & stir fried beef horfun are definitely good.
The service staffs are busy. So much so that they served the soup without sending us the bowls & serving food without cutleries. Understand that they are busy so we get them ourselves."
A wonderful experience at Syun. High quality food and their lunch sets were of amazing value. Their signature beef with uni was divine to say the least! We appreciate the team who was on point with their service delivery and very attentive as well.
"We celebrated our 7th wedding Anniversary at Chaleur and we were treated to one of the best dining experiences ever! Food was amazing in terms of variety, plating and taste! Staff were extremely friendly and approachable taking the effort to check on us and explain each dish in great detail. Chef Masa was extremely friendly as well and even walked us out when we left.

Will be back for their winter menu! Can‚Äôt wait!"
"I am deeply disappointed with this MacDonalds. I ordered a 20 piece nugget meal takeaway that comes with 4 tubs of curry sauce but to my utmost dismay, when I got home, I was met with 0 tubs of curry sauce. I called the MacDonalds to ask them to rectify this situation as I was really craving curry sauce with my nuggets.

They did nothing. Refer to picture attached (note: no curry sauce) I was forced to rawdog these nuggets with garlic chilli. Displeased."
"Excellent services, celebrating mum's birthday here. Staffs here are all very friendly and helpful, from ordering to serving to cake cutting, they even sing the bday song together with usüëç.. Food here are great, craypot crab with vermicelli is the best especially the soup, chilli crab came with bit of spiciness best to eat with their mantou, ÂÜ∞ÈïáÂíïÂôúËÇâ surprises us as its really crispy with slight cool on the outside but hot when u bite onto it, their truffles salad is one of their signature, great presentation with dry ice effect. Their ÂØåË¥µÈ∏° is also a must try, full of ingredients like sea cucumbers, sea asparagus, scallops, fish maws and slices of Abalone, the chicken is really tender and flavourful, goes really well with juz white rice alone. Overall we really had a great dinner and celebration here.. Highly recommended üëçüëçüëç"
"Prices inexpensive, serving Indian Muslim Food,  No alcohol served. Foods: uttapam, dosai, masala, bryani, prata, nasI goreng,"
I found the information regarding what they actually offer lacking online so I talked to a friendly male staff about it. They mainly do buffet and wedding packages but they also actually offer ala carte menu as well. This review is more for posting their ala carte menu photos for the benefit of everyone. I will go back for the food someday.
"Delicious north Indian fare, especially dishes from the tandoor - perfect combo of spices and smokiness. Highly under-rated and not well-known being outside the traditional Little India area but I have gone here many times (especially after visit to Kings Barber next door - also worth a visit) and have always had a great meal."
Food was good but pricey. Service was attentive as well. We had the 2 person set and changed the cereal lobster to Butter lobster and pepper crab and finally clam kuey teow and wasabi prawns. With a mango dessert.
"Restaurant Ibid provided an outstanding dining experience. The food surpassed our expectations, delivering a truly awesome culinary journey. From ambiance to flavor, every aspect contributed to a memorable evening. Highly recommended."
"It‚Äôs the nicer branch as it is right beside a quay. Fairly crowded on Friday night but service was swift. Battered fish was the best, grilled fish could be more tender. But otherwise a good place for fairly priced seafood. Apple crumble pie with ice cream was warm, crumbly but perhaps need more ice cream to satisfy the sweet tooth in me."
"We went there on Saturday night without reservation and could only get bar table.
We ordered steak, salmon, salad and cake. Despite the not so comfortable table and chair, the food was very good. Tasty and well presented. The steak was tender and juicy. Really loves the salmon. And the service also very good. Overall, good experience and will definitely come back."
"Brought my wife to Taverna Greka Restaurant and I must say, it was an experience beyond compare. From the moment we stepped in, the ambiance was warm and inviting, setting the stage for a memorable evening - I had made a reservation for balcony seating. It is decorated with greenery & flowers decorated along with soft warm lighting added a touch of romance to the whole dinning experience.

We ordered each a 5 course dinner set. Each dish was a masterpiece of flavor and presentation, showcasing the culinary expertise of the chefs.

What set this restaurant apart was also their thoughtful attention to detail, especially when it came to celebrating birthdays. Not only did they provide delicious complimentary desserts, but they also went above and beyond to make the birthday celebration truly special for my wife.

Lewis & staff not only ensured that our dining experience was impeccable but took great picture and frame it up as a gift for us. He also led us to a picturesque spot nearby for some unforgettable birthday photos, and even emailed us the pictures. His hospitality truly added an extra layer of delight to our evening!

Taverna Greka not only serves excellent food but also goes the extra mile to make every occasion unforgettable. Will return to try the rest of the menu."
"We went there for having dinner nobody even bothered for taking order even after waiting for 10+ minutes, the staff were taking order dor other tables but didn‚Äôt give any attention towards us, hungry, waiting for food but no other option so we walked out of the restaurant‚Ä¶"
"Had a good time catching up with the live World Cup match.
Friendly place. Decent food and drinks options.
They are open till midnight but last order is around 22:30.

Although the menu is good, the food is quite alright . I‚Äôd prefer them to work on the mint chutney, as it wasn‚Äôt very authentic. The chilli-pakoras are must try though.
Pool tables are available for pay-to-play.
Toilets are clean.
They have outdoor options.

Location wise , quite accessible too . Family and kid friendly atmosphere too .

Ambar, who works there was quite helpful and would come over and have a chat with the customers . Great staff !"
"Was recommended to dine here, I must say I was rather impressed by the quality and portion.  All our orders are well divided before being brought to us, portion was really generous and filling.

Really love the truffle uni capellini, and the service standards of service staff. Tiramisu (baileys) gals alittle short of my expectation and I feel can be better, but otherwise the rest of the food were great!

Will recommend to call in for a reservation."
"Waited in line to eat here. When it was our turn, we were led to a bar in the back of another area across the street. We ordered 2 beers and dumplings‚Ä¶ 5 min passed. The couple next to us (that was sat after us) got their beers. They ordered dinner, 10 minutes passed. Still no beers. Finally flagged down the host and he brought our beers. We asked the server about the dumplings and he said they were coming so we ordered dinner. The rice shows up for our meal in minutes after ordering. We ordered seafood rice, but this has chicken in it. I questioned it and was told the seafood rice does have chicken in it? I am pescatarian so perhaps that should be indicated on the menu if it has meat. Asked about the dumplings again and we were told yea yeah they are coming. We did get the dumplings shortly after and they were mediocre at best. I requested chili oil in vein. To make this shorter, it was terrible. We never got all of the food we ordered. (The table next to us never got ANY food) We had to argue so that they would take the food that we never received off. This was a restaurant full of unhappy guests and extremely confused servers. Perhaps we caught them on a bad night but I wouldn‚Äôt give them another chance."
"Beautiful location amidst the Dempsey Hill restaurant cluster and greenery !
Value for money food
Homely environment, gives the feeling as if you are attending a function where the food has been cooked at home and being served by the host on banana leaves !
The fish head curry is one of the best in Singapore !
The chicken , prawn and mutton preparations are tasty as well !
Comes with endless servings of rice and lovely condiments till you are bursting at seams !
Try the awesome Teh Halia (Ginger milk tea) or any other freshly made house pour !
There‚Äôs outdoors and indoors seating ! Outdoors provides a nice view of the greenery around !
The staff have amazing memories, no pen paper , and all orders are taken by ‚Äúbrain work‚Äù and service is delivered without mistakes and with lot of care ! They are very helpful and patient in assisting with ordering as well and will not misguide or make you over order !
Love the overall experience here and keep going back !"
Great crispy lamb and beef dishes. Rices a little expensive (2 SGD per person). Staffs looks very busy due to heavy load of delivery food. But generally it‚Äôs a good place to have you lunch.
Delicious dim sums with ample choice. Surprisingly plenty of vegetarian choices available too. Water is charged but tea is topped with hot water as often as you want. The food arrived fast and was piping hot. Service was friendly and efficient. Highly recommend for a good family meal. There is something for everyone. Fair warning - the chocolate ducks have runny and very drippy chocolate sauce!
"We had nasi goreng kampung, mee kuah, maggie goreng, mutton soup & paani puri. It was above average than most I‚Äôve had before. Don‚Äôt mind coming back again. üëçüèº"
Cool ambience with a pool table and varieties of alcohol. Finger foods are available. Ideal place for chat and discussions after a busy schedule.
Nice view of the river and food is quite tasty! Worth the money if you are into the view.
"Always come here for the fish head option. Tried both kind, Assam & curry‚Ä¶quite good. It‚Äôs very flavourful and strong which we prefer. The ingredients is plentiful and the size of the fish head is pretty reasonable for the price we paid for. Just a fish head is good for 3 pax of average eater. Will try the mix Assam and curry the next time round."
We threw a party at this restaurant. Our guests wouldn't stop raving about the food. Thanks Vir and team!
"‚ÄúBest lunch ever‚Äù was the comment from my kids. Ordered hotpot and katsu set, everything was amazing, including the price!"
"1 hour plus waiting for the pizza, and suddenly they are serving pizza to other patron that came in way after us. When we enquired about our food, the staff just retorted with a rude manner ""We are busy"", and when we asked about recommendation they simply said ""Dont know"". Might as well build a vending machine here."
"One horrible staff; rude and expect the customer to know what to do. Serving customer with a earpiece in his ear. His business must be very big... need to wear ear piece. Other staff were nicer, saw what he did and came to speak to me instead. Doesn't seem local, male with ear piercing.

Saw two staff (one of them same as above) use their hands to take the popcorn from the popcorn machine... erm... at least use a hand glove?"
"Great view with spots of shade during  hours before sunset

Ambiance : good music

Staff : friendly and fast

Food: food came out quickly ... Calamari ok, hummus ok
Could improve on the cut of the steak ü•©

Drinks : served cold"
"Been here few times for the buffet, this is the first time I experience dining at the bar area and the food is great!"
Neighbourhood eating house. Cannot expect too high. It has neighbourhood standard. The prices are quite high. Mutton $5 and fried fish $4 each.
"Wanted to try the eel porridge but it wasn‚Äôt available. The other items tasted OK but not so impressive to make me want to visit again. Overall, very value for money. The prices were reasonable and the portions were huge, especially so for the mixed beef pho. The fresh spring rolls contained so much vermicelli that they were more a meal than a snack. Coffee was rather weak. Staff were friendly. Ambience was so so but it was good that Vietnamese music was played in the background. There were both indoor and outdoor seatings."
"Service: 10/10
Ambience: 6/10
Location: 7/10
Food: 7/10
Damage: $80 for 3 pax

For someone who doesn't fancy Korean food, this place serves pretty good Korean food. Pancake was tasty and budaejjigae was filled with lots of ingredients. I want to mention the staff there was very helpful and gave us complementary seaweed for our fried rice at the end. They even gave my friend a mask because his broke. Well doneüëç"
"Very nice. Especially enjoyed the green curry. Probably among the best I had in SG. The rest were also good, but could‚Äôve been better if they were a bit less salty. Fantastic service! We enjoyed the lunch very much."
"A quirky little restaurant in an out of the way location, this place is worth looking up. 100% gluten free plus a whole page on allergens to help those with dietaries. The food was sensational, service flawless and they even helped us get back to the hotel using their own Uber app when we couldn‚Äôt get a taxi. This is a must visit in Singapore. I would recommend booking ahead. Thank you!"
We tried new dishes this time and surprising the rice crackers taste so nice with the sauce! Recommend their fried kuay tiao too! The crab fried rice is more of average.
"This restaurant is kind of hidden underground via a stairway outside the building... The atmosphere is nice and cozy, food was great and they served alcohol as well."
"Decided on the 4 course lunch set without regrets! The staff were very attentive and helpful for orders along with the recommendations. Everything the staff recommended was delicious and glad I listened.

I had the Earl grey lavender w strawberry to accompany my meal, which was fantastic and wasn't too sweet. The Pork Floss Tamagoyaki was so simple and yet very flavorful with every piece. The Spicy Cumin Lamb & Mushroom Udon was delicious with every mouthful and had the right amount of spice to it (the staff compared it to mala medium spiciness). The Fried Mochi Bun was a great ending to the meal with a great combination of the texture of the chewy Mochi in the center and the flavors of the bun pairing the ice cream on the side.

The music at the place was also not too loud and had very chill vibes which compliments the environment itself of the restaurant/bar.

Definitely would recommend!!"
"Nam Kee is an 40 years old-school Hainanese chicken rice shop where it is located at Upper Thomson Road‚Ä¶.

Food:
Honestly , it is not the best Chicken Rice in town. But, they serve relative delicious Thai-Chinese Cuisines. Among my favourite dishes are Sambal Fried KangKong and Deep Fried Tofu.

Service:
The staff are quite friendly and attentive. Ok‚Ä¶ acceptable service‚Ä¶

Atmosphere:
Old school and nostalgic decoration, with its latest change perhaps the air-conditioned which was installed in the late 90s.  It quite comfortably to have my dinner here.

Verdict:
I quite like the texture of chicken breast - soft and tender. May return  to try Thai steamed fish, curry fish head and roasted chicken in future!"
"Beef is very very sweet, and they definitely skimp on quality to control prices on the menu. Good for budget if you want to eat sugar meat and rice."
"Abit confusing when entering for dining. No specific queue on if you are waiting for take away, for collection or for waiting to dine in. There was no one to guide the customer. Look like they are short handed.

Disappointed with the popcorn chicken. Is cold and dry, must well remove from the menu."
"Qualifier for my ratings, particularly for the atmosphere. While it is a casual restaurant, it was clean and cool with big fans blowing when you eat so it does make you enjoy the food and company better.

Foodwise, very decent renditions of patience food, especially the staples such as the putien meefen and lor mee. Comparable to other famous putien restaurants. Where it does not fare as well would be other dishes which I think not be particularly representative of putien food, but I may be wrong...

Service was polite and prompt. Definitely worth a visit if you stay in the east and craves for putien food. Price wise, acceptable for the settings.

Definite plus point would be the open air gantry parking right outside the restaurant."
"The menu here is intimidating because it contains Indian, Thai, Indonesian, and Chinese options. However, this being a halal restaurant with all the cooks appearing Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan, or Bangladeshi, I chose the Indian dishes. I enjoyed my food and drinks and hope to re-visit. (August 2022)"
We celebrated my niece birthday and as we had quite a few people we were given a room which provides the privacy. Service was attentive and the bbq was done before they serve.  So we do not leave the place smelling like bbq. Plus a huge variety of banchan. Abit pricey and might not be for everyday. But for special occasions it is a good choice for korean bbq
"Very nice and breezy kampong vibe. Their menu was quite lengthy cuz they have pictures attached next to each dish (which was a very nice thing, btw!)
The coconut water was SO SWEET and my mum loved the steamed chicken so much.
Price wise it‚Äôs definitely on the higher end, but they do have a student discount. :)
Would recommend coming here at night for the vibes‚ú®"
Been patronising here since open. It was good when it 1st open with service and food quality at expected level. Today was real disappointment as the sambal stingray wasn't BBQ enuf and totally not authentic. The sambal was sweet and not spicy at the least! The claypot tofu has only 6 pc of small tofu and can tell its ore cooked then pour in claypot. I am expecting claypot sizzle. I am always a fan since your opening but today i paid 33 bucks & left unhappy
"Zen Restaurant in Singapore, nestled within a Michelin-starred hotel, is a culinary sanctuary where artistry meets gastronomy. The dining experience transcends mere sustenance, immersing patrons in a symphony of flavors meticulously crafted by master chefs.

From the moment one enters, the ambiance is a harmonious blend of tranquility and sophistication. The minimalist decor, adorned with subtle Asian influences, sets the stage for a dining journey that transcends the ordinary.

The menu is a testament to the chef's dedication to perfection. Each dish is a canvas, showcasing the finest ingredients and innovative techniques. The sushi, a delicate dance of textures and tastes, highlights the restaurant's commitment to authenticity. The sashimi, served with precision, melts in the mouth, a testament to the freshness of the seafood.

The culinary artistry extends to the hot kitchen, where traditional Asian flavors are reimagined with a contemporary flair. Signature dishes, such as the miso-glazed black cod, exemplify the chef's mastery in balancing flavors, leaving a lasting impression on discerning palates.

Service at Zen is an impeccable ballet, with attentive staff anticipating every need without intruding on the dining experience. The wine list is curated to complement the diverse flavors, elevating the meal to a sensory journey.

In conclusion, Zen Restaurant in Singapore not only lives up to its Michelin-starred status but transcends expectations. It is a haven for connoisseurs seeking a symphony of flavors orchestrated with precision and passion, making it a jewel in the culinary crown of the Lion City."
"Ordered prawn paste chicken, onion omelette, and HK kailan. The dishes were done quickly and we appreciate the speedy service.
There was pork floss sprinkled over the kailan which was unusual for us, as it made the dish too sweet. The prawn paste chicken lacked flavour, tasting like it was fried in reused oil. Maybe we caught them on a bad day as the other reviews seem pretty decent.
The eatery was small but there is plenty of large tables available."
"Good quality of food. It was delicious. We had the iberico pork, dessert, squid, tuna, risotto. They were all delicious. Ambience is great too. The Chef even customised a ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù wordings onto my dessert as it was my birthday. Great service.
Definitely highly recommended."
Two of us had lunch here. It actually inside the Tunglok Seafood Restaurant. The food served was fresh and nice especially Sashimi. The service staff was also attentive and helpful. Great experience! Will visit again!
Good food and reasonable prices. Pepper crab is tasty and steam fish well cooked. Will come back again.
Butter chicken biryani among the better ones I tried. Pappadom so light and crispy that the fan easily blew it off the plate and I couldn't resist buying more. Will be back to try other stuff for as long as I'm still working in the area.
"We have been frequenting the restaurant for the last few weeks. It‚Äôs been a great pleasure to dine here as the food is authentic, the service is solid, and the ambiance of the alfresco dining area is peaceful. Moreover, it‚Äôs extremely value for money. Definitely recommend you giving this place a try.

Our family favorites are pan-fried sea-bass, the calzone (upon request), and the homemade tagliatelle pasta dishes. The ingredients are authentic and unpretentious, and are ultimately comforting. Oh, and the desserts (tiramisu and molten-lava cakes) are delectable as well."
This super affordable Tze char has the best sweet and sour pork rice ever. Beats the top restaurants flat with this single dish. üòä
Very nice new Indian shop in this area. Must try ‚ÄúGhee Masala Dosai‚Äù
Without a doubt the best meal I ate in my entire time in Singapore. This was despite the fact that I was eating from a set menu which perhaps didn't represent my natural taste. Every course was delicious. The scallops were of particular note. Perfectly cooked. The sous vide pork is unmissable and comes beautifully presented with edible flowers. Staff were impeccable and of course one is looking out on the beautiful tropical surroundings of Espa. Recommend.
"Tuesday lunch. We had signature claypot chicken, egg omelette and 2 dishes of vegitables. The claypot chicken was delivered boiling like magma:) I‚Äôd love to know how they can make chicken so tender. Their service is swift and  friendly"
"A cozy authentic Chinese restaurant in New Upper Changi Road. Value for money. Ordered sliced pork strips with green capsicum n 5 sticks of beef BBQ , goes well with a small bowl of rice."
"1st visit.  Didn't want to get messy and avoided items that need to be deshell.
Food - Good. Unique dish like Truffle Ice Plant Salad, Chilled & Crispy Sweet & Sour Pork. The Ice Cream (with Mao Tai) is unique, too (the serving can be better)
Good service. However, the place can be noisy.
Will visit in the future to try the crab dishes."
I have ordered the Xiao Long Bao here twice now. It‚Äôs the only time I have ever tried it- thought it was really nice though. I have just ordered some from a dumpling place here in Australia and it has made me realise just how good the ones from Crystal Jade really were! I need to go back to Singapore so I can have them again!!
"Delectable authentic chinese restaurant cuisine at pocket friendly prices! Tried this place after walking past a few times and saw crowd on Friday and weekend nights.
I enjoyed all three dishes that I ordered! The grilled fish had the right amount of spiciness and saltiness, lots of vege, beansprout and beancurd skin inside, stir fry vege in garlic was fragrant and the È•∫Â≠ê was flavourful.
Snow brand beer only $4.50 and do try out their imported Wahaha yogurt drinks to cool down from the spices!
No GST nor service charges, staff were friendly and accommodating, free wifi even. A hidden gem in Macpherson!"
"Wanted to try due to the superior rating.
However I would say do not expect too much.

The place has a nice atmosphere, with some hipster touch
Food wise, portions were good and filling for us. However I would say nothing amazing, but it is a comfortable meal.

Drinks were not bad but the strawberry flavours had a fake flavouring taste.

Lava cake was pretty good.

Tom yum seafood pasta was also decent and portions was filling. Might be abit spicy for some"
Nice food especially the chickpea n the nans but the chicken bryani is abit disappointing as it's already precook so it's not piping hot.
"As a frequent visitor of this place, I find their food pretty decent. I just wish they would serve thosai and prata during lunch as well.

Nonetheless it‚Äôs still worth a visit!"
"A recent dinner at Black Society left a deep impression on us. Ordered several dishes at the recommendation of Ivy Koh. Overall, a palatable experience, foodwise, as well as a pleasant dining experience executed by the waitstaff. A special shout-out to Ivy for her service excellence and great  recommendation. The crab bee hoon was simply on point. Thumbs up!"
"Our go-to spot for delicious prata and nasi goreng, complete with convenient free parking right in front of the shop."
"We're so impressed with the high quality of food n the outstanding service from Simpson, tt we returned the very next night!  Wd like to compliment the Chefs + Simpson n his team. We will definitely return n highly recommend to our friends."
Wonderful delicious Hong Kong style cooking ! we enjoyed the food very much
"Generous portions, fast service and tasty food. Highly recommend the garlic pork!"
"Food was 10/10, very affordable as well! Loved the food, except for the kimchi fried rice I think it is a bit too wet. The ban chan was refillable and great. Highly recommend the grilled meats. Everything was good!"
Excellent service espcially from Uncle Bob who made great recommendations.  He is frank about the amount of food and helped us order just the right amount.  No wastage :).  The service from other staff were friendly and professional.  An attendant was kind enough to inform us of the use of chope vouchers. The meal was sweetened by complimentary ice cream and after dinner aperitif.  The food of course was delicious.
"This zichar joint is constantly busy throughout the weekend and it‚Äôs unsurprising. Each dish on their set menu was delicious and we found the prices very reasonable. Our party of 5 had 3 fresh crabs, 1 meat, 1 toufu and 2 vegetables. The restaurant kindly throws in rice, mantous and ice cream as complimentary items!"
"Great Atmosphere, good food and the chef is friendly. First class service. We ll go there again. 1 for 1 cockage which is great."
Our favourite place for North Indian food. Great taste!!!!
White rice had weevils in it while spinach had sand. Duck was juicy but a tad salty. Food overall was not bad. Pity the hygiene was subpar..
"The Spot consistently delivers excellent food and service. After a positive experience, we returned, and it never fails to impress. Kudos to the restaurant manager, Norman, who went above and beyond to ensure we had a wonderful time. His attention to our food preferences when suggesting dishes was greatly appreciated. Managers like him are truly exceptional and worth keeping!"
"Kaveri is located at the food court of terminal 2 - which is where I visited.

I believe they also have an outlet in the terminal 3.

They allowed the use of lounge key for a massive meal and a Masala chai.

Recommended‚Ä¶!"
"Perfect evening and food. Service can be improved.

Scallops $22, 4/5 - frozen variety but done well. Leek was hard to chew.

Pink oyster mushrooms $14, 4.5/5 - something like battered mushroom fries, perfectly fried (oily) but thinly crisped. This dish came late.

Veal brisket $36, 3/5 - meat did not pack any taste. It was a bit tough, but could be pulled apart. Jus/mash was tasty but could have been a bit more concentrated.

Tuna steak tartare $20, 4.5/5 - quite a perfect rendition, tartare scooped onto a flower pie tie cup. Four servings but adequate as a main in my opinion. Could have been more chilled if intended to serve cold.

Bombe alaska $28, 4/5 - mostly for show. Inside was dark choc ice cream, outside was caked in meringue and sponge. Tasted below average but the fire was a nice performance.

Cocktails were $16-18. Negroni and tequila sunrise were decent.

House pour sparkling wine $12 - quite impressive. Well chilled and serving size was nice.

Service: We came under a reservation which had an anniversary note (Chope), but when we arrived, the staff did not ask if we were under a reservation, and just gave us a table for 2. Luckily i did not have Chope vouchers or promos to use.

I ordered pink oyster mushrooms as a starter, though on menu it was a side, and ordered the tuna tartare as my main, which on menu was a starter. This, the waiter did not understand. I ended up receiving my oyster mushrooms at the same time my partner received his main.

Essentially the waiter served my partners starter (scallops) and then asked me if my oyster mushrooms was my starter and then that the kitchen would prepare it. Quite disappointed at this but they can only learn."
We had the best green curry pork here. And the chicken is fantastic nice. Even there is less staff and we waited a bit but it was still very good. We sure come back again many many time
"The whole experience was just beautiful. The food not only looks nice but also tastes delicious, and the service is top notch. We did not get to catch the names of the staff we met there, but we are grateful for the service and would love to come back! Great job team Poise!"
"There were so many dishes I wanted to try but did not have enough stomachs. Will come back with more friends so we can try the whole menu! Tried the kueh pie tee and hotate ceviche, and a glass of umeshu. Food was fantastic, service was excellent and staff were very friendly."
"Visited for the first time after hearing good reviews from friends. Awesome ambience and child-friendly. Helpful staff who helped us with food orders and wine recommendation. Dips were great, octopus tender and flavourful. Desserts were also delightful. The standout dish was the lamb chops!"
"WestEnd bistro is more of a neighborhood restaurant with community ties, and a warm, cozy, inviting atmosphere. Great food and really pleasant services. Value for money. A must place to check it out! üòã"
"Chanced upon this place randomly for supper.

Was very pleased with the super cold Aircon and ambience.

Smokeless charcoal BBQ equipment was very effective

Only had 2 dishes as we were not so hungry.

Side dishes were the usual fanfare but very appetising.

Had the BBQ beef kalbi
Beef was so fresh and tender.
Really worth a try.

And soy bean paste soup.
Was super umami, surprised to find so much crab and clams in it.

The service was super awesome.
Will definitely be back to have a full meal.

Thanks."
"We ordered the Chargrilled Octopus (5stars) its very soft, beautifully grilled and deliciously paired accompaniments. Corn with cob (5STARS) is nicely grilled, the spices used is a nice pair to it. We also ordered the house made kombucha(5 stars). Came in a jar so it can be shared by 2. The wagyu steak and cassava fries are okay (3-4stars) probably cos they arent our taste."
"Food is nice and delicious

Viru who is on duty is very attentive to details and provided excellent service.

Will certainly come back to Banjara again soon."
"Ever since covid start, did not visit them.
Really love their Claypot touhua, chicken wing, blueberry porkchop, cabbage dried scallop .. üòõüòãüòãüòã"
"Good South Indian, specially Andhra Cuisine restaurant. Must try their thali and other non-vegetarian dishes (again south Indian specials). Its over crowded over weekends filled with Indians majorly.

Food was too good, service was quick, and looked little ordinary compared to Singapore standards at Jewel."
"Purchased a mongolian style beef rice with egg, costed 11 dollars. For the taste and portion, it is way overpriced. Will not eat from there again."
"Oxtail Bone Marrow Murtabak 8/10 (Kimchi was absolutely fantastic)
Prawn Tosai Pajeon 8/10
Tambi‚Äôs Maggie Goreng (Spicy) 8/10
Soft Shell Crab Biryani 10/10
Banana & Coconut Tart 9/10 (Balanced sweetness)

Excellent service by Mr. Jay!
The restaurant is a fusion of Korean & Indian cuisine, where Thevar & Meta restaurant chefs collaborated and created this lovely spot."
"Great tasting and authentic dishes here.

We ordered the Ëæ£Â≠êÈ∏°ÔºåËèúËä±Âπ≤ÈîÖÔºåÊãõÁâåÈÖ±Ë±ÜËÖêÔºåÈÖ∏ËèúÈ±º„ÄÇ

Strongly recommend these 4 dishes as we finished it all.

The Ëæ£Â≠êÈ∏° was fragrant and juicy, first time we had such a juicy one, compared to most prepared elsewhere.

The ÈÖ∏ËèúÈ±º was also very savoury and generous in portion, but may be a little fishy for some people."
"a small cozy nook beside Tori-Q that serves really amazing dons!! I have been back here sooo many times to eat the salmon hotate don which never disappoints. Sashimi was super fresh and tastes really good while still remaining affordable. Really good for a nice meal out with friends.

Prices here are all nett, so no service charge! They also haven‚Äôt raised prices since GST went up to 8% so kudos to the owner for making their food so fresh and affordable for all those looking for good-tasting Japanese food."
Great place for Indian food.. affordable and near authentic.
