"Need a car üöó to come to this place.
Was here on Monday evening & was surprised a band performing that night.
Beautiful sunset üåÖ & sea breeze to chill with drinks üç∫ & food
Staffs are responsive & with a smile whenever you need their attention"
Love the curry & nonya fish head. The prawn paste chicken is nice too. On average I pack about 6-8 dishes for takeaway. Just googled & found this Zh Char - tried once & love it - so far this is my 3rd takeaway within 2 weeks. Yet to try their crabs - will feedback once I tried.
The food is nice and fresh. The yakimono and grilled food is highly recommended. The service is good as well. Will definitely come back again!
"It was my first time at Restaurant Gaig, and I would say the food here is simply amazing!

Restaurant Gaig‚Äôs menu showcases Catalan dishes with traditional recipes dating back to the 19th century through Chef Marti‚Äôs innovative interpretations. They also have a really good selection of wines that you can consider going with the meal.

Highlight from the new Chef‚Äôs Menu ($180++ per diner) focus on the no wastage nose-to-tail Gastronomy ‚Äì Lamb

Location: Restaurant Gaig,  16 Stanley Street Singapore 068735"
"The bistro is large and spacious, offering a diverse range of food options from an extensive menu. The prices are reasonable considering the portion size, and the food itself is remarkably delicious. It's certainly a hidden gem in the area, and I would definitely choose to dine here again if I find myself in the vicinity."
"Ordered Prawn Biryani and I was served rice with Prawn curry instead. The egg Biryani was served with rice and egg curry too.
Butter chicken seemed more like Chicken tikka curry.

All disasters in the name of taste and authenticity.

I hope the restaurant hires a good chef, who understands the true recipe combining it with right flavors and taste."
"Had dinner there and the staff attitude (not all) are very lousy. One of the PRC lady seems very impatient and annoyed when I ask her questions nicely. Every time I ask her something I feel like I own her something that kind of feeling. When ask about the exact ingredients of the item cos it was written chicken but she keep saying it was Pork... she end up cannot confirm what she is saying.
Also end up one of the dish was the wrong item and we have to wait for very long while other dishes were finished. It wasn't a busy day for the restaurant but overall the service is just way below standard"
"Came here for birthday celebration.
Nice atmosphere and thank you the Chinese lady Manager who always fulfils and cater our needs !
Definitely a worth place to visit üéâ"
"Service staffs are friendly. Good food and nice ambience, next to the turf club. The only downside is waited too long for the salmon to be served. The beef cubes are surprisingly yummy üòã"
"This is the restaurant that purportedly invented the world famous black pepper crab  of Singapore.

We had our CNY gathering here and therefore there was the quintessential Loh Hei dish. The rest was part of the set menu including crispy roast duck and black pepper crab. And here they provide an extra bowl of the black pepper sauce just in case you can‚Äôt get enough of it.

Restaurant has al fresco dining and indoor including a second level with air conditioning."
"Such an amazing experience! This was one of my favorite nights in Singapore. The bar area is beautiful and all of the staff are so nice. We tried a few drinks and they were all great. We didn‚Äôt have any food, but the food we saw others order looked nice. There‚Äôs great views of the city on both sides. Make sure to make a reservation if you‚Äôre wanting to book a table that‚Äôs outside!"
"Service are top notch and their food are above average!

Downside is that theres lots of chef recommendations food oos."
"Chanced upon this eatery at Square 2 while looking for a lunch place. Decided to try though I am not a spicy food lover and not a fan of curry as well.
We ordered 2 sets of Tonkatsu sets that come with salad and a drink. Food took a while to come but from the first taste of the curry (Level 1 spiciness) I was hooked! The curry was perfectly cooked and the spice level just right. The pork was freshly fried and totally worth the value.
Don't understand how those lousy reviews come from also üôÑ
Give it a try if you are at the area. Payment is by a kiosk just outside the entrance and accept all cards and Nets."
"Booked table for 2 for our wedding anniversary and totally enjoy ourselves!

Tucked in a nice cosy east coast road with ez parking just steps away from this restaurant.

Waiting staffs were fantastic attending to our needs and helped us took photos! (As attached) .

Steaks were well recommended by friendly manager and it was well cooked by chef.  Complete with in house wine it's the perfect Lovely evening.

Highly recommended!

"Frequent patron for saffrons as I live nearby..
food standards hasn‚Äôt dropped, long time staff service is also good
I only have an issue with the new cashier; some uncle wearing specs..always wear grey. either he can‚Äôt hear properly when taking order or he cannot understand difficult order request like spicy and all. He needs training lol cuz he keeps asking me to slow down when my order is already relayed to him slowly and clearly ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"Enjoyed a snack (Jewel Hiro Chicken) and happy hour drink (Lager Young Master) before getting down to a dinner of sandwiches (snow crab & fried fish) and truffle fries. Due to the circular design of the outlet, it was a tiny bit difficult to catch the staff if they weren't deliberately walking more than halfway around as my table was at the back of the space. However, every staff that I encountered was friendly, polite and professional. The food was yummy and surprisingly filling despite the fact that the portions didn't look very big. Would recommend a visit if you're at the airport. Oh the Yuzu Sake Spritz tasted like a non-alcoholic citrus drink. Dangerously yummy!"
"Briyani rice is a little spicy. Mutton is tough, don't try if you got weak tooth, there are no dentists around here. Try the chicken install."
"Good food, seafood was very fresh.
And they served Kung Fu Tea at the end to reduce greasiness of food too. Nearby have multi story carpark which was a short walk way."
"Food is nice, specialist at draft beer. Chilling at  outdoor , lovely view towards Sentosa."
"Had beef chuck eye roll with a drink ($13.90) for lunch on 4/1/24, was good & value for money."
"Brought my friend there to makan for her bday! The dinner set is worth the price. i ordered the crab pasta taste was soso, the calamari was quite blend. Dessert was better than the main courses. Ambiance was okay."
"Came this evening (15/02/24) for a valentine date. Very disappointed in the food and service here. Initially saw it on TikTok when some influencer promoted it, it looked good there. Now I understand, maybe it was a paid promotion.

First of all, the atmosphere is not the best. Tables were placed very close to one another. When you walk in, it just doesn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre walking into a hotel standard buffet.

Then the service, the man at the sashimi bar was rude. When we ask for the sashimi, we are greeted with ‚Äúwhat you want?!‚Äù In a very rude manner and they way he communicates with the customers is not nice. However, the staffs were fast to clear our used plates on the table and were borderline friendly.

Last, the food. The sushi doesn‚Äôt taste very fresh and of good quality. Same can be said for their snow crab legs, it wasn‚Äôt as fresh. The meat was rather dry and tasteless. I did not eat any of the raw food as I‚Äôm allergic, therefore no comments on the sashimi, mussels.

The cooked food was below average. It includes the self serve rojak station, roast pork, roast chicken, ghor hiang, herbal duck, stir fry pork and grilled chicken.

The acceptable cook food that was pretty good was their fried bee Hoon & chicken satay. Those were pretty yummy.

The WORST dish there was the Chilli crab. Now I don‚Äôt expect Tzar Char standard but it wasn‚Äôt even close. The crabs were extremely small, the meat was so dark in colour and it breaks apart so easily. It felt like the crab was stored for a long time. It taste very very bad. The sauce was okay with the mantou.

Overall, I would not pay 98++ (dinner) for a buffet of this standard. Won‚Äôt be revisiting."
"Briyani was fragrant and not oily
7.90$ for chicken briyani and teh halia. clean and hygienic place
Greeted by random cat on my way out. Charming."
Food is nice and i have visited a few times after the reno. Hygiene needs to be improved - i had to swat a fly away from my food. Tables are not cleaned and left to customers to clean on their own.
"Ordered mutton bryani.
Food was cold! Top part was hot bottom part was cold!

Whole restaurant only 3-5 people when i vist at around 4.35pm on 1jan2024.

The first thing the service staff tell me is no more food. Only left mutton bryani which is the food i wanted to eat.
He doesnt seem to be interested as i was not done with my order. I had to call him before he left after serving another family to follow up on my order.
And prior to my order he didnt even bother to give us a menu and insisted only left bryani and we had to ask for drinks menu to catch some of the drinks that are supposedly still available.

Food had 1 small hair on my yogurt! Can see in photo! Very hard to spot.

My wife had advised me not to visit as the review is bad and as a fan of indian food i couldn‚Äôt help myself but go against her advise.

Atmosphere at the cashier have a strong stench smell. The cashier girl only pass us the bank receipt at first, we had to ask for the food receipt then she give us.

How can a restaurant in Jewel be so ^%*]¬•}¬•^<! Up?
Can imagine the motivation i had immediately after the meal to send in this review, because to spread awareness so naive patrons be warned and have no regrets üôè"
"Ordered delivery from the store on New Years Eve, understand that it‚Äôs a busy period and they missed my garlic bread order. However, 2 of my feedback on this issue via website has been unresponsive. Would appreciate a reply."
"Samy‚Äôs Curry in Dempsey stands apart with a distinctive ambiance, diverging from the sophisticated, fine-dining feel of its neighboring restaurants. Instead, it embraces a canteen-like atmosphere adorned with an 80s colonial setting, offering a nostalgic journey through time.

As a family-owned establishment, the culinary highlights include the fish head curry, squid, and fish bergedil (fried fish and potato cutlet). Served in a generous pot, the fish head curry captivates with its spicy, tangy profile, enriched with curry powder, tomatoes, tamarind, and a subtle sweetness. The marinated squid delights with its moist tenderness, while the fish bergedil boasts a pleasing texture and aromatic appeal. Unfortunately, there weren‚Äôt many vegetarian options to choose from.

Samy‚Äôs Curry Indian Restaurant in Dempsey offers an unassuming haven for delectable and reasonably priced meals. Despite its popularity among tourists, it remains a go-to destination for an authentic banana leaf meal in Singapore, preserving its status as one of the city's best."
"Had an amazing dinner here. The food tasted authentic Thai, huge servings, service is prompt and welcoming and most of all the ambience is just wow. We dined at around sunset and we are just facing opposite the yacht! The cost is reasonable as well and we were very surprised considering the location. Highly recommend this place! You won't regret üòâ"
"Super cheap and authentic local food.
One of the better coffee shops you can find!
Really nice and friendly Coffeeshop uncles and aunties that make you feel warm and happy!
Always leaving with a full tummy and a happy heart :‚Äô)"
"The best French restaurant I have experienced in Singapore so far. All the dishes are well cooked and yummy, had a good time together with friends, restaurant manager Jerriek is very attentive and helpful, we lover his service! Highly recommend"
"Very bad very bad
All the time missing foods or changed foods.
31/12/2023 today missing 2 medium fries.

Never order again in any country"
"Authentic Korean food and hospitality. The service staff gave great recommendations of food and drinks, and were extremely attentive to all our needs. Whenever we've to adjust the heat of the hot pot, start on the next course of sumptuous fried rice, or more drinks! They were right there when you need them. It's such a surprisingly great experience!"
"Food here was AMAZING! Every dish that was recommended to us was so delightful to taste. Highly recommend the mushroom ravioli for starters, the crab pasta, and the pizza (crust was so nicely done) ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

Service was great too, they provided 4 wraps for our fajitas instead of the usual 3 as we came as a family of 4. He also shared these amazing recommendations, thank you very much! üôèüèº‚ò∫Ô∏è will be back!"
"Delicious sze-char dishes. Must get the sambal pomfret. Any dishes that come with their sambal concoction is best friend with bowls of rice. The homestyle tofu was smooth and full of umami with those crispy mushrooms. The green vegs with fish floss was great as well. Service was quick and efficient, dishes came out quick and fresh."
"I takeaway four prices of prata kosong at $1.30 each. The size of the prata is probably the largest I have ever eaten!

I was given two large packets of gravy. One is fish curry, the other was Dahl.

The fish curry was sour and a little too salty.

The Dahl was thick and not watery. This is the first time I ever like Dahl curry!"
"Service needs alot of improvement as short-staffed (staff also insist to clear dishes really fast so we felt pressurized) but food is still good nonetheless!

Pasta and pizza dishes were both great and on par with other branches.

Cashier also require further training as I was paying using a standard chartered credit card to redeem the promo on my mobile but staff asked me twice if I confirm it to be a standard chartered credit card as it does not tie with the list that they were given. Standard Chartered changed the appearance and repackaged the unlimited card so‚Ä¶."
"Food was average, service was average, atmosphere was average. All in all very average. But the food did arrive quickly, was fresh and fair quality ingredients. The nice part was it was overcast/drizzling the day we went so the kids enjoyed playing in the park outside. The chocolate banana shake was yummy!"
"We love Tze Char places, had to queue 40 mins after we arrived around 530pm (Sat)
Been here once at their previous location further up the road. As usual, we ordered dishes we love, hor fun, chilli kangkong, bitter gourd w/sliced fish, Ngoh Hiang, yong tau foo, beef w/spring onions, roasted chicken + one big bottle Heineken
Voila only $150, for 5 of us, can‚Äôt be happier. Highly recommended for those who love tze char dishes anywhere anytime"
"Their food was as authentic as you could get in China. The crowd was also mostly Chinese nationals so again it says a lot about authenticity of this place.

Dishes were served in speedy fashion, the chefs were utterly brutal in their execution; dishing out item after items in record time. Please make a reservation prior to heading over. I overheard from the staff speaking to a walk-in customer that there‚Äôs 8 more names in the waiting list.

Have to drop one star because of the sanitary conditions of the place. As it‚Äôs a really small establishment, everything seems very cramped and a few times I have to walk like a crab just to get back to my table.

Floor was sticky at most areas and towards the back of the shop it was wet with grey most stains all over. Imagine a wet market walkway. You‚Äôll get the drift.

Probably the best way to enjoy this will be to order take out and eat in the comfort of your home if you‚Äôre picky with cleanliness."
"This place opens up at 11.30am, earlier than other lunch spots in the area. We decided on a mexican fiesta and as such, popped in for a quick fix and to our delightful surprise, we were not at all disappointed.

My dish was about $19 before GST. It was fried chicken with loads of tomato sauce on it, with cilantro rice and nachos on the side. My friends had nachos and enchiladas. The flavours were good and the cilantro rice was so yummy. They didn‚Äôt skimp on the cilantro and the rice was cooked to perfection, every rice with that intense cilantro flavour. My chicken was fried to perfection, and it was juicy and moist. The serving size is generous for what you‚Äôre paying.

The restaurant service was attentive, and I loved that they provided free iced water to patrons. Such should be the standard of more restaurants in Singapore.

The decor was quaint and cute."
"Most important aspect,  place is clean and friendly service."
Great place. The staff is great! Thank you Muslim for your concern
"Had the Poori set , Masala Thosai and 2 drinks. Total price was $8.70, very reasonable. Portion was big and taste was good. The drinks were not sweet, just right. Only issue was the air conditioning was not turned on, so it was super hot and humid, almost like being in a greenhouse. Im sure during peak hours they would turn it on, i guess they were just saying money."
"Highly recommended! Yup ! My kind of place! Call me fussy ! Had amazing Duck, fish & chips: Fish was moist & fleshy, chicken wings, endive salad a fav, charred broccolini , gambas & risotto all extremely good too. Oh forgot the dessert was super good too. Can‚Äôt rave enough about the food since i am fussy! Haha. Love the ambience away from the mad crowds ! Sharon biz development person & Chef explained what goes on behind the scenes to make it so yummy and happening. There‚Äôs an elegant private karaoke room too ! Was a Wonderful experience. Will definitely be back ! We had about 15 of us including kids for Sunday brunch/lunch ! Was not disappointed. Oh There‚Äôs an impressive wine cellar too ! Keep it consistent and attention to details matter ! Will bring me back with friends !"
"Food was excellent and tasty. Although many years ago at the Havelock branch the food have more variety and taste better. I think that it is because of the ""pay as you like concept"", most people do not pay a lot. That is why the number of dish are lesser now and more cost effective dish are served. This makes sense because rental and staff are not cheap for them too. I read through the review and there are some complain about customer service. Personally I do feel it and get what they mean. I don't feel very comfortable eating there, this is the first time I feel this way in a restaurant. Maybe because of the ""pay as you like concept"", and most people don't pay a lot. The feeling is like you are there for a free meal. It is a nice place and I like the food there, I rather that they charge a fix price for the buffet rather than the ""pay as you like concept"". Maybe their 3rd floor can have a buffet corner where they charge a fix price. And people will be more comfortable there. I love the food there but I do not want to be treated like I am there for a bargain or free food."
"Ordered the Okonomiyaki and was given a choice to cook by ourselves or the service staff. Since it was our first time at the restaurant, we chose the latter. It was an interesting experience to see the service staff prepared and cooked right in front of us. Next time we would do it ourselves for experience.

The Okonomiyaki has 3 indigents of our choice but were kind of overpowered by the cabbage and sauce favour.

Overall, an above average food in a nice environment and an interesting dining experience."
"This is a South Indian restaurant majorly, does offer North Indian cuisine too. I find this restaurant OK, can do a lot better

Note: the portion size is usually bigger than usual restaurants hence keep it in mind while making orders. We had to parcel the left over food."
"Not so crowded place. Food portion is decent, music is forever Jay. Price is affordable too. Ate with 4 pax. And our bill size was about 72 dollars. Good for lunch! Service was fast too, very little waiting time, and ice water was a better. Choice compared to the other drink options. I was told that the jug of tea was not worth it. It's almost tasteless! Definitely coming back again for better lunch set. Its so cheap. As cheap as 6.90 only! Cheaper than my lunch area food. Omg.! Thanks N for recommendation"
"Really enjoyed the food. The menu had a great selection of dishes, each packed with flavour and beautifully presented. The service was great, very friedly and efficient. Try it, you won't regret it!"
"Fantastic experience at this Japanese restaurant with good music, attentive service, cozy ambience. Highly recommended!"
"Have not visited this restaurant for many years ever since they moved away from portsdown. Its still the best place to enjoy a good Italian meal üëç

The place is located just outside office building on ground floor. Just $1 per entry during weekend.

We ordered our favourite pasta and burrata cheese salad(come with ham) + bread which brings us back memories when me and wife will still dating.

The potion of the cheese it's huge and enough for sharing at least 4pax. The squid ink seafood pasta come with alot if ingredients and already de-shelled.

The service is still exceptionally good! They changed our plate and cutlery after we finish the cheese (starter) and help to keep us comfortable and enjoy our meal."
"Went for our Anniversary Celebration yesterday night at Greenwood Fish Market @Quayside Isle. Overall food was good and we love the environment and atmosphere but was disappointed there are no more Resident discount.

Me and my family have been a loyal customer of this restaurant for quite some time, and I've always appreciated the discount provided to Sentosa Cove Residents. However, during my yesterday visit, I was surprised to learn that the discount policy had changed, and the staff's communication about this adjustment was rather disappointing. The person I spoke to seemed uninterested in addressing my concerns and exhibited a somewhat rude attitude. I've always valued the positive experiences I've had here, and the change in policy coupled with the unfriendly encounter left me feeling disheartened. I believe that clear communication about policy changes is crucial, and it would be beneficial for the staff to approach such matters with a more customer-friendly demeanor. I hope the management considers these aspects for the benefit of both loyal patrons and the overall reputation of the establishment."
"They are having a promotional breakfast set that costs $6.90 for a main and a drink. I was expecting the portion to be small and so I ordered the salted egg mayo croissant as a second main. But boy, was I very wrong. The portions are decent for an individual. The food tastes good too, and I especially love the achar like salad that comes with the croissant - it helps to get the appetite going. The laksa gravy is rich, which probably explains why they pair it with yellow noodles. It would have been better if they serve traditional Southeast Asian type of coffee instead of cappuccino or lattes. Overall, it's still an enjoyable dining experience. üëç"
"Authentic Thai cuisine in the middle of a private neighbourhood at Clover Park. Walking distance from Bishan mrt. They also have other outlets. We had tom yum soup, green curry chicken, kang kong, pineapple fried rice, phad thai. You can choose the spice level for the tom yum soup, also comes in clear or milky soup.

Portions were a little small for the carbs but overall we enjoyed the food. Service was brisk and it wasn‚Äôt too crowded when we went for dinner."
"Good serving size. Had the butter chicken, biryani, garlic naan, etc. Flavours were there and spicy level was mild. Yes, the region makes a difference in the spicy/hot levels."
"Premium sushi chain - friendly servers, limited selection, and slightly above average prices as compared to other chains. Quality is definitely great, but would struggle to find the last star with the selection and price."
"Having a great time dining with the ladies at 21onRajah ..
Love their buffet style and the service staff is good...
Happy tummy with lovely atmosphere there.

Shall dine in again soon :)"
"Was there for a post Christmas lunch and we had the lunch set which came with Trout. Presentation was really nice, colours were amazing, as was the restaurant decor and service was attentive.
Unfortunately we had a bone in the trout which personally for me, in a place like this, marred the experience. While the servers v briefly apologized i don‚Äôt believe it was genuinely addressed to my own expectations. Maybe a misalignment of expectations i guess - may give the establishment a second visit in future but just perhaps not yet."
"Had stir-fried pork belly with rice this evening, and it was one of the worst I have ever eaten. I wasn't even expecting it to be sizzling hot even though it's served on a hot plate, but the food was like cold and oily. Will not patronize again."
"Had an amazing time here chilling by the beach and celebrating our friend‚Äôs birthday! The staff were very nice and helpful‚Äî allowing us to change our reservation, helping us with photos, storing of cakes and even prepared a customised card and dessert for us! Would definitely come back another time ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"I went to the Soup Restaurant at Clementi Mall to have my birthday early celebration. I thought we wasn't allow to make reservations during weekend but call them to check and in fact I was able to so. Just had the scrumptious meal today and would like to put up few lines for the review. Very friendly and helpful staffs. I have ordered the Appreciation Set from them. Dishes came out real quick and we completed our meal in 1 hr. No rushing though, just nice pace for us. Dishes seems not too much or big but ended up quite filling. They have a good judge of serving potions to prevent food wastage which is nicely done. I like the soup and the samsui chicken very much. Other dishes were OK. Take a look at the pic attached."
"At Pasta Fresca Da Salvatore in Siglap, dining transcends mere eating; it's a symphony of flavors and hospitality. From the succulent Italian pork sausage to the perfectly seasoned wedges and delectable mushroom sauce, every dish is a masterpiece of Italian cuisine. The chef's expertise shines through in each bite, showcasing a careful selection of ingredients and skillful preparation. Moreover, the warm, crusty bread served with fragrant olive oil before our meal, along with the gracious offer of iced water despite not ordering beverages, exemplifies the restaurant's commitment to exceeding expectations. It's these thoughtful gestures that elevate the dining experience, making it truly unforgettable."
"I decided to check out Tim Ho Wan at Jewel for their National Day specials. The restaurant is decorated with a Hong Kong cafe style. Functional. The customer service is average. We ordered the fish porridge, abalone chicken tart, deep fried chili crab spring roll, steam chili crab bun, char siew Chan Bao. The porridge is good. So is their signature char siew Chan bao. As for the rest, it is forgettable. The taste is flat and bland. The spring roll is too oily and I could savor any chili crab sauce in it. The steam bun is also sparse. If you are hungry and all other places are packed in Jewel, then head over to this restaurant."
"Food really nice +, environment is great+, staffs are friendly. Foods are so good to taste. Love the tiramisu."
"Happy hour beer at $10++, wine at $12++. First time to this outlet, but I noticed the portion is smaller now. Had the beef don before at somerset outlet, the beef was done medium, but here it‚Äôs a little overcooked. Taste wise, still acceptable. The chicken teriyaki‚Äôs sauce was super delicious. Oysters happy hour going at $3 per oyster. Fresh! Will return."
Was here for a Wedding Lunch and pleasantly surprised by the well thought out vegetarian menu they served being a non-vegetarian restaurant. They was a good variety of dishes with my favourite being the ÂúüË±Ü‰∏ù (Stir-fried Shredded Potato) in this starter. There was also a giant Ëç∑Âè∂È•≠ (Lotus Leaf Wrapped Rice) towards the end of the course which everyone had a hard time finishing. The staff are nice but perhaps a little too casual and sometimes rough when serving - bumping into things and attendees. I was quite surprised when one of them just poured the leftover peanuts onto the plate I was eating from. It was also crazy cold and parents had to keep carrying their babies outside to warm up.
"Service is good, food comes at a great pace, the place has dimly lit lights, nice atmosphere if eating here for dinner, the food is delicious."
Contains 2 selection of cuisine - western and Asian. It's a buffet breakfast that I've eaten. There's decent variety of food there.
"Coming from a GenZ, the music was definitely spot on and all of us were having a mini (soft) karaoke session while having our food and drinks. Since my friends and I weren‚Äôt able to decide, we called on one of the waiters to give recommendations. Least to say, it didn‚Äôt disappoint! We were encouraged to try food as well as drinks out of our comfort zone which we absolutely loved! (night king and dragon spritz) Other than that, the staff did not forget that we were there to celebrate our birthday and gave a complimentary chocolate cake as well! I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family!!"
Came here for my bday dinner in January. Enjoyed the food and ambience was nice on a weekday evening. Prices seem reasonable as well. Would visit again
"First time. Service was not bad. Redeemed new member free tomato soup and garlic bread, and ice lemon tea. These were great and I'd high hopes. Mains were salmon and shrimp and spaghetti (no complaints, nicely done), and New Zealand sirloin and spaghetti (this was frankly disappointing. Ordered it medium rare but it was so hard to cut and I had to chew it like a cow üêÆ). For the price, I'd expect better steak but overall ok except for the steak. (A side note, iced water is available for about 20 cents which is quite pleasant)"
"Good food, good service. Price is on the higher end but the food is good. Set menu may be just enough, so if your appetite is large, recommend you order a couple of more dishes."
"This was my first time at Pixy Restaurant.

The food were all made from the freshest ingredients, with seasonal flavours. The chef (boss) is extremely friendly, and the sole waitress complemented him very well, as a dynamic duo.

The Sakoshi Bay Oysters were extremely fresh and the Sashimi Carpaccio was immaculately grilled on the outside, while  juicy and tender inside.

Their Kagoshima Wagyu Beef A5 steak was accompanied by an exciting array of vegetables and sides.

Its Japanese Carbonara was very creamy and rich, and it contains top grade bacon.

A very good dining experience, and I look forward to return there.

"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Restaurant Suzuki.  It was truly an exceptional culinary experience. From the moment I stepped inside, I was captivated by the restaurant's elegant interior, which perfectly set the stage for what would be an unforgettable experience.

There were many highlights to the meal. One of my favorite was the aburi sushi, especially the kinmedai sushi.  The perfectly seared fish was expertly prepared with the precision that only a fine dining establishment can offer. What made this dish truly exceptional was the ingenious use of shouldering wood, infusing the fish with a delicate, smoky flavor that danced on the palate. It was a masterclass in culinary artistry, a delicate balance of technique and creativity.

Another favorite was the beef dish. The beef was cooked to perfection and melts in your mouth.

The entire omakase journey was a symphony of flavors and textures, each course thoughtfully curated to showcase the finest ingredients and the chef's extraordinary talent. The attentive and knowledgeable staff added to the overall experience, guiding us through the courses with grace and expertise.

This restaurant has undoubtedly earned its place among the finest dining establishments in the realm of Japanese cuisine. I look forward to returning for another gastronomic adventure."
"Ordered 2 plain thosai, 1 Uttapam and 1 paper thosai and they gave only 1 packet of chutney and sambar even though I request for extra sambar and chutney. How to eat thosai without gravy?"
One of the best masala thosai and kothu parotha I‚Äôve ever had. Our family kept coming back here. Sathish also took good care of us while we were here.
"I finally achieved Pani Puri freedom today and ate a lot of them. Apart from Pani Puri, there are also Gobi Manchurian and Paneer Makhanwala, which I like.  Paired with Sultana Pulao, Mirchi Paratha, and Plain Kulcha, it was a perfect match and made me eat one plate after another.

The negative side that the management would like to improve on will be letting the diners enjoy our meals instead of rushing us off. We felt so stressed when we were not even done with our meals, the staff came over to clear away all the plates. This is very obvious chasing us off, just for the others in the queue to come in. There is no time stated for buffet. They should not do it this way. Seriously, I hope the boss of Kailash Parbat read this."
Unique lamb hotpot. Soup is quite nice albeit oily. Ordered a few other hot pot items not shown in picture. Total damage for 2 pax (ladies) was $160. Quite expensive I would say. :(
"Ordered a fish burger and large fries at 19:40hrs
Waited and waited until 20:15hrs still not ready.
Upon seeing others had their orders collected.
Went up to the counter and verify only to understand ordered wasn't being process.
Best part.. not even an apology.."
First time here. Good first time experience. Was recommended by people i met at a plcae just across the road. Place was fairly crowded with drinkers and diners. Crowd looks friendly though. Had a couple of beers just to soak in the atmosphere. Beer prices are standard.
"If you want to try out some good Japanese dishes at reasonable prices, this is definitely the place where you should go!
My favorite dishes are Garlic Udon, Scallop Dynamite and Beef Sukiyaki, they are very popular too.
Sake or any alcohols is also very reasonable compared to any other restaurant! I recommend Sapporo draught beer.

You'll definitely have a good experience and would like to visit again to try some other dishes.
They have surely made two loyal customers :)"
"No matter how tight is your schedule in your Singapore visit, you have to try the crab plate in Long Beach UDMC. UDMC is rightfully famous for its delicious black pepper crab, the plate that I ordered there. The crab is cooked tender, and the sauce is incredible. This was my first time eating a crab and I am definitely not disappointed.

I should warn my European friends that the price rates are quite high in this restaurant, the prices are excluding tax (US style) and no service in the restaurant is free (even tissues).

I recommend Long Beach UDMC for visiting once but only once"
"Been craving for lobster rolls.
They said lobster are from Maine, but texture definitely different.
In Maine, lobster meat size are bigger and texture is a bit chewy springy which i love.
Luke Lobster meat is similar to Indonesia's lobster texture.
A tad to hard side without springiness.
It is still the best one so far, none competitor.
But compared to Maine lobster roll, average.
I've had way better Lobster roll in Maine.

Grilled Bun is soft and full of butter flavor.
Lobster is mix with mayo, butter and lemon.

Ordered lobster claw too, which is a disappointment. 3 tiny claws with shrinking meat for S$10 (in their photo looks big)

Lemonade is not freshly squeezed.

At least they provide hand washing station for your convenience."
"A gem at NTP Lorong Chuan. Easily access via lorong chuan mrt station (exit b).
Friendly service, good Japanese food.
Next ti
me to try their omakase, need to pre- book 2 days."
"One of the better seafood restaurants that you can get in the east in a very traditional setting. Food is fresh even for takeaway. There is a discount off the price on the menu for takeaway as the prices in the menu seems to include service charge. By the way, the yam paste is not too bad!"
Steak and pasta super delicious!!!! Staff friendly and excellent service! We loved it and would come againÔºÅ
I went there for the first time yesterday and liked the food and drinks especially the otak otak but what I think was good was how patient they were and never rush us or ‚Äúshow face ‚Äú while we celebrated birthday there till closing time. The staff  were all very helpful and kind. Rare to meet service staff like this nowadays. They also made food specially for allergy requirements of my daughter. üëç
Serving mostly tour groups.
"Asked the lady what fish they used for the seafood hor fun, she said snakehead, I don‚Äôt take fresh water fish so I told her not to put and make it less salty. Ordered the 9 to take away, when I got home and started to divide the hor fun meant for two, I counted 7 tiny prawns around the size of a fifty cent coin and no other seafood, was already disappointed but what made it worst was it was super salty, and why say seafood hor fun when only tiny prawns was inside. 9 for this!"
Food was great! Marinated Pork collar highly recommended. Sarah was so attentive to all our requests.
"Ordered food for delivery after soending $$$.00
Received a message saying we dont have a driver .,,
With a photo of food on the countrr
Eventually food arrived there was no chutney for the chaats only the water for oani puti
All the chaats were stale snd ols
Asked the manager oh we get back nothing

Very disappointing service snd to be homest the worse food ever .

If you cant provide a service it should be told @ the time
Do bot send stale food when customers are paying alot of money
üò°ü•µüò±"
Strongly recommended by a friend to come try. Indeed. Nice authentic Italian restaurant. Great healthy delicious foods and fantastic tiramisu. I enjoyed the nice cup of macchiato too! Must book to get a table.
"Food quality and portion are big. Taste good but service quite bad. Short of staff and tables are not clear. Fruit juice, dessert and ice cream only 1 man handling and queue becomes long. Place wise is good especially now celebrating Oktoberfest"
"Wide selection of fresh dishes, cheese dip, free flow Thai chilli  and other sauces, chopped garlic and chilli padi, prompt service, attentive staff and friendly boss. Just bring friends!

Also check out their collab with Rochor Beancurd House: Green Thai Tea Soy Milk, Soy Beancurd with Green Thai Tea, and Grass Jelly with Thai Milk Tea! I love the Soy Beancurd most! üòãüòã"
"Went there and order a set of ramen with ice cream and hot tea. Atmosphere is nice,family friendly. Staffs are nice and polite.

But there are few areas that I hope the restaurant could improve on:

1) the ramen soup was very salty. ( I don't know if it's my personal opinion, but this is the saltiest soup I've ever tasted.)

2) Dessert is served together with the food. By the time I've finished my ramen,my ice cream have already melted. ( From my experience dining in other restaurants, usually after u had finished your meal, then you request the staff for your dessert)

3) Hot tea is served in a porcelain cup, which make it too hot to even hold it. ( I could only able to drink it after it became cool tea üò≠)

If all the above can be improved,I don't mind coming again. If not, this might be my last time dining here again."
Reasonable price and the steak is cook to perfection. Salmon fish was also cooked just nice to retain moisture content. Service crew was also friendly and helpful on the food recommendation. Keep up the great work and thanks for the nice dinner for our family.
"Burger is slightly too oily but the taste is great, pairs perfectly with their refreshing ale!

Serving is quite slow, don‚Äôt go if you are in a hurry to catch a flight.

I enjoyed their hand washing machine, quite interesting."
"Everything is old school here, including the gents."
Prawn paste chicken is very good! The soup for their fish soup is better at the mayflower outlet though but still decent.
"Food was AMAZING!! I had ""The GIANT (Aust. Beef) 230g"" the meat was soo juicy and tender... one of the most tender meat I have consumed. I highly recommend üëå"
"Fantastic Harry's seven! Happy hours go until 8pm, make sure you come before then!"
"Enjoyed their cocktails and my husband ordered their signature dish chicken debal which he was super impressed with, it has a nice spicy kick to it. Peter the owner was there tonight serving and was so personable such a great host, we enjoyed chatting to him. We sat outside and it was lovely such a great atmosphere. The prawn crackers as a complimentary entree was a delicious surprise. We'd definitely come back and try more food and cocktails! Awesome service too."
"Service is damn slow. just to purchase take away for 1 bloody single food.

Never going to here again.

Should have just gone to Street 21 instead. Near block 208A."
"I have to give this restaurant a 5star rating. The quality is top notch - the wagyu cubes, scallops, fresh oysters just to name a few. And the aburi sushi are fantastic.
We went on a Sunday night and we were surprised that the restaurant was quiet. It makes our experience more cosy.
The only thing lacking is there wasnt any dessert, besides ice cream. And there wasnt even any green tea flavour ice cream.
Overall, Hokkaido sushi is highly recommended. Will definitely revisit."
"Too expensive... Very unfriendly staff too, the basically very annoyed faces and very impatient... Prepare about $8 per person eating only 2 3 items..."
"We have waited at the restaurant for 30 mins, no food still. If you can‚Äôt serve within certain time frame, the restaurant should stop taking order. As simple as that."
Wanted to order from a new place to try out. This was recommended from one of my friends and turned out to be a great choice. The food is authentic Indian and rightly priced. Can wait for Dine-in to start to go over to the place with family and friends. The butter Chicken and Chicken Lollipop are must try.
"Good variety of food at about $2 per plate. Buffet is $30 each so if you eat a lot it‚Äôs quite worth it. Food is served relatively quickly, place is often packed but didn‚Äôt have to queue too long."
"South Indian food quick bite restaurant,  very little sitting space,  card only place,  courteous staff members,  reasonable prices,  beverages also available,  famous for masala tea."
"We had our solemnisation and dinner here. Really nice ambiance and photographs turned out to be exceptionally beautiful. Staff was extremely friendly and attentive. Service level was impeccable. We spammed the whole menu and everything tasted great. The salesperson Tony who introduced us to the venue was helpful and attentive to our needs throughout the whole process. Tony, the restaurant manager, the chef, all the staff, all worked very hard together to make our special day memorable. We are really really thankful for Path for giving us such a wonderful day!"
"Purchased 2 crunchy cones to take away.
The waffle cones were soft.
Brought back for an exchange which the manager changed.
Still end up with the same soften waffle cone.
Disappointing experience.
I was expecting that a new batch of waffle cone will be used for replacement."
Despite busy period the staffs are friendly and patient in assisting their customers. The ambient was so homey bcos of the people working at this outlet. Our food was on time and was really delicious.Keep it up team and the girl manager
"Good choice of dishes but very poor cooking. The pork slices in our ginger pork dish were cold, only the gravy was hot. The meat must have been pre-cooked, don't know how long ago, and the gravy simply warmed up and spread over the meat. Our order came super fast after placing order.
Another dish, black bean bittergourd was served much later and was piping hot and presented what we expected - food cooked to our order, not pre-cooked and warmed to serve.
So, it's your luck if you order common popular dishes which ingredients are prepped ahead and cooked en-mass with other customers' orders.
Dishes were very salty with lots of lard and oil. Cannot tell them less salt and no lard - staff taking orders told you it's no use, the cook won't care and could not be bothered. At one vist, we asked for less salt, no oil, our food came super salty and oily - better that we had not said, lesson learned!"
"This is what Thai food should taste like (to me, anyway). I used to live in Thailand, but have always found Thai food in Singapore to be a bit disappointing. Soi 11 and  their Thai chef seem to have got it right. I asked for my grilled pork salad to be spicy, and it was perfect. I‚Äôll definitely be back to explore more of this interesting looking menu. Run by really nice folks, too - service couldn‚Äôt have been better."
"Staff were generally friendly and attentive, but lobster was a big disappointment. We ordered a 2.1kg jumbo lobster grilled, but it came overcooked and the tail meat was so tough and dry that we could not chew on it. For the price paid, the kitchen should know how to manage simple grilling of lobsters‚Ä¶ Spoke to one of the staff who said he would check with the kitchen to see what can be done, but he did not get back to us at all. Disappointment overall and will not visit the chain again."
"Service by the staff was exceptional. It may be cause we were seated outside, it was slightly hard to catch the service crew's attention. But when we can catch their attention, they will give you their full attention. Kudos to that. Food was also wonderful and when we talk about Korean food, we will automatically go back at Chang. üëçüèª"
"Swensen is one of our favourite dinning place but nowadays they employed all foreigner no doubt they still do what they supposed to do, however they do not present themselves in good manner. Maybe lack of staff or so ( especially peak hour ) Food taste is still fine but portion strink n some sides for meal not included anymore."
"A Restaurant with a View

The Bimbimbap I had came piping hot. It tasted great but there was not much meat in it. However, this was compensated by the free side dishes they provided.

While the Bimbimbap price was reasonable, the BBQ meats were priced quite exorbitantly. 100g for $35.

Service was good. Whatever earlier reviews about bad service seemed to have been solved. We were seated almost immediately and given a nice table. Service was prompt and responsive.

This restaurant has a reasonably nice view of the waterfall."
"Parking is quite challenging here.
Food is just ok. Price is ok for such an environment. The western fish and chips is not fresh and defrosted quickly. The hokkien mee is too soggy, feels pre cooked in big batches.
The nicest is Penang fried kway teow"
For years this coffee shop has always been dirty. Not a pleasant place to sit and have food without looking at how dirty the coffee shop is. The food is not too bad.
"Food - Decent. A little overpriced considering the portion size and flavour. My burger was served on a wooden board that looked a little mouldy. (picture attached, you be the judge) The icecream seemed to have shrunk in size over the years, and was already melted on the outside by the time it arrived on the table.
Service - The male waiter that seated us was really polite and friendly. Was apologetic when we realised one of the chairs and the floor below it was wet. The other male waiter (who seemed to be the manager) we interacted with was really rude and impatient (the restaurant was not busy) when we were ordering our icecream. There was also a mix up with orders a few times, and we had food/drinks sent to our table by mistake. Other than that, service was pretty quick in terms of us getting our orders.
Atmosphere - Nice restaurant with a good view. However, since this is a family restaurant, there will be screaming kids from time to time.
Overall, this branch of Swensens has been on the decline for a while now, and I think it's time for my family to stop giving it yet another try."
"Beautiful place + great atmosphere makes this a good restaurant to go to if you're looking for a semi-fine dining location. The food was really good too, especially the beef cheeks. That said I had to dock one star as the lobster bisque we ordered was too bitter. It wasn't just strong, as they warned us. I feel that they had overcooked the lobster stock. For the prices of their dishes I expected better. But I would still highly recommend people to go here as the place really is beautiful and the service was absolutely lovely."
"The service was attentive and the food was delicious. We had the winter menu so no pigeon dish but we especially enjoyed the chicken, marron, wagyu, and pork dishes. Other dishes like their bread with chicken butter and prawn caviar dish were also well executed. Chef, came to plate the potato dish which was fermented and probably the best mash potato we ever had. The two desserts: melon and caviar were lovely too. In the end they brought out a complimentary birthday dessert and petit fours.
All in all we had a great night and we hope to come back soon!"
"Restaurant Born: A Culinary Masterpiece Unveiled

From the moment we first encountered the unique touch of Chef Zor Tan at Restaurant Andre, it was evident that a distinctive culinary voice was waiting to be fully expressed. We've had the privilege of experiencing the inaugural menu and the second menu at Born and both were excellent. Every dish not only captivated our senses but also unveiled the depth of passion and innovation that underpins the chef's journey.

Born's ambiance masterfully intertwines a welcoming warmth with sophisticated elegance, a testament to their meticulous attention to detail. The impeccable service mirrors the very qualities of warmth, professionalism, and thoughtfulness that they exude.

Watching Chef Zor evolve from his time at Restaurant Andre to taking the reins at his own establishment has been truly inspiring. Thank you for sharing your unparalleled culinary artistry with us.

We wish Restaurant Born all the very best and continued (well-earned!) success!"
Had a pleasure dinner with family at here. The true stars of the dinner were the Chinese Mitten Crab and Cod Fish. Each bite was a delightful mix of sweetness and savoury goodness.
"Chance upon this restaurant on YouTube. Decided to bring Wifey to try out.

Ordered: Â∞èÈæôÂåÖÔºåÊ∞¥È•∫Ôºåbowl of Noodle, plate of vegetables, spicy chicken & 2 ice blended fruit juice.

Note: The ***spicy*** chicken serving is really huge...Didn't know prior. (Serving size is approximately 4 to 5 pax. They don't have smaller size). End up having to packet the remaining.

Nice food & ambience. Try to avoid peak hours or come slightly earlier to avoid crowds. No booking required and no dress code."
"4 stars for the food not for the SERVICE! Pricing wise it‚Äôs acceptable and food is great but service wise they need to reorganise their worker and work flow.
Firstly, waiting time for food is so long not saying it‚Äôs a weekend or weekday other tables that are later than us got their food first and when we went to double check on our food their worker replied ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a queue so must wait‚Äù okay fine we wait so 10-15 mins later the food is not here yet so went to check again and told them our table have yet to have any items on the table they seems to be suspicious about us not telling the truth so we have to went back and forth many times just to check on our food order.
Secondly, I saw they put some food items onto their metal trolley which belongs to our table okay so we assume they were preparing our food but they didn‚Äôt! They left the food there and serve other tables food first while leaving those sides on the metal trolley!
Thirdly, after such a long long long time we finally get our food and guess what the person came to ask us to pay for our food. Wow we wait for our food for that long and you want us to pay our bill plus on a side note they miss out some of the items that were on the list.
Fourthly, there will be a lady incharge of billing and she will bring it to the cashier. So apparently this happen we told the lady that some items were missing and pass her a $50 together with the bill and she said she will come back with the change but ended up the lady came back claiming that we did not pass her the $50 but we did! Then next, one of her co-worker wearing a sarong top came and said ‚Äúyou guys said you pay the money but where‚Äôs the money‚Äù umm hello lady how the heck will i know where the money went we definitely did gave your co-worker the money for our meal!!! She claimed that there is 4 person working so which is the lady that we pass the money to? Umm i only see like 1 lady working throughout the entire shift tell me where is the other 3?
Lastly, the lady who took the $50 drank alcohol with her friends. Wow mind-blown man clap for this place‚Äôs mookata can work and drink at the same time.
Okay folks that‚Äôs it for the review of this place go ahead and try and see what experience you will get
( this is not our first time there eating the mookata but it will be our last time for it )"
First time trying out Hokkaido sushi. Nice and quiet place. Good ambience. Surprisingly the place was quite packed so reservation is highly recommended. Not too much of a variety but food was of high quality and service was prompt. Love the century egg tofu!!  Ordering system through handphone was simple and efficient. 2 pax for around $106 at lunch on a weekday. Definitely value for money.
Nostalgia brought my friends and I back to Porta Porta. The location may be different from the old one at Changi but the food and staff definitely bring back the memories. Am so glad the quality and taste remain the way we remembered it. Chatting with the lady owner/chef is like taking to an old friend or relative. Thanks for all your hard work!
"Amazing food! Their lunch promotion is very affordable with 3 courses. All of which had large portions and generous servings of prawns. 15 plus plus per person. Recommended to try their pad thai, sweet and spicy, very good. Even their thai milk tea is thick and not diluted. Their service was good too, very fast and efficient. They promoted their lunch promotion with enthusiasm."
Best
Simple zhi char fare. Actually its quite good. I like the ÁîòÈ¶ôËôæ. The curry fish head gravy was very thick and flavourful. This could be my next favourite place for curry fish head and seafood! They are having promotions for crabs by the way ;)
"If you are looking for a casual and fun Italian restaurant, this is the place.

It was surprisingly the crew that made the whole experience for me. They were friendly, attentive, could even get in on our jokes for a bit. Its a hot Sunday afternoon by the sea, you couldn‚Äôt ask for better vibes than this.

Food wise - Everything was fresh, delicious and beautifully presented. Nothing to fuss about! We were a group of 5 and had more food than what i‚Äôve attached in photos. They were so good i barely have time for proper photos before we dug in.

Edit - i just realised so many other people here have sung praises for the crew. Seriously, great job you guys!!!"
"Was there around 2plus and we could get seat easily. First time trying the beef cheek today and I thought it was not bad! Very tender and I could pull and shred the meat easily. Have not ordered the salmon for quite a while and it was still the same. I like the gravy with the right acidity from lemon. Nice veggie patties too. However, the salmon dish might not be suitable for those who don‚Äôt fancy something buttery / cheesy. The chicken wings are still the best - must order! Ended the meal with my fav cake!
Got tempted and went to get the soy ice cream cone but erm - not to my liking! But, with just 50cents, you get a token and can go and have some fun! LOL"
I like the delicious seafood hor fun. I will ask for less salt for Hokkien noodles. The staff is friendly and good customer service.
"Tried the grilled pork with rice today. Pork was well grilled but was hoping for more flavor. Was hoping for some vegetables for freshness also.

What stood out was the soup though. It had a unique citrusy taste."
"Portion is smalll for the price (referring to broccoli and the popcorn chicken). Wasn‚Äôt really impressed with the beehoon as it was so-so, when they seemed to be putting it as their signature dish.

Most of the seats are empty on Saturday noon but the staff for some reason want us to sit towards the side where many other customers are already seating, which makes it‚Äôs less spacious for us. Cannot comprehend, but just go with it.

honestly the food was okay only. Staff were overall friendly. Food was served a little slow.
First time trying and probably won‚Äôt come back for quite some time"
"Was sooo good omg!! We had their white pepper crab, it was super flavourful and fresh! Also had the venison, the meat was very tender and totally didn‚Äôt disappoint for our first time trying it!!! Overall would definitely recommend this place üëç"
"Went there for family gathering but I guess they are overwhelmed thus service & food wise not really up to standard. When ordered set, shld be 2-3 dishes first but it keeps on coming in & filled up the whole table.  Food not according to what we've request in terms of sequence so not very impressed with it. Before i start my meal,  the cutlery are not cleaned too cos the stain still can be seen,  quite disappointed overall."
"An amazing dinner experience where I was so impressed by not just the taste of the food, but the ambience and especially the service.

I felt so welcomed and taken care of right from the beginning till the end."
"Ordered Seafood Pancake - thick with flour, only 1 pc of squid per slice

Korean Fried Chicken - Crispy thin skin, very oily but not what I expected from

Korean style fried chicken.
Squid & Pork Belly Bulgogi - Was I supposed to order either/or or its a combination? If its a combination, there's zero trace of squid, sweet tasting.
3 plates of kimchi side dish, it was good.

Blew almost 50 bucks on this meal.
Likely would not return again.

Edit: None of the staff understood my order."
"Decided to sacrifice hawker food for Swenson as the weather is super hot. Had a great meal. Ordered the Caesar salad with deep fried fish bites, Spaghetti and chicken thigh in herb sauce. Meal $59. Food tasted ok but not fantastic. Service was fast and smooth."
Food is delicious!!! Definitely will bring friends back again.
Food here is pretty delicious especially the otah. However be warned that their zichar (non rice/noodle) dishes are not wallet friendly at all. Eg. Hotplate tofu cost $18 here.
"Came for late lunch and watch the rugby world cup. Place was full 1 hour before the match and even when it was full service was great.
Had the Charlie burger and it was pretty good.
Prices are about what you pay for the area.
Overall not a bad place to come and watch a game."
"We really enjoyed the food here - the braised beef cheeks and uni Sakura ebi angel hair pasta were stellar, and the desserts were also surprisingly good (as we aren't generally keen on desserts). The pastry of the Paris Brest is baked fresh which made it perfectly soft and fluffy with a crisp exterior, and it's filling was a good balance of flavour texture without being too rich"
Good place to lunch at Tuas. Big portions.
Surprisingly decent food and drinks. Can vouch for the kothu prata and chilli cheese and pratas as well as the teh halia. Dosas are so-so decent.
"Been on a hunt for Japanese restaurants in the neighborhood and finally made it to Nara (despite knowing about it for years - just never felt the motivation). Ok, this is one of those that is hard to rate - you know those that are not really spectacular neither were they below average/ or poor value. Think I'll leave it as that."
"Ordered the sambal stingray ($16)- the sambal was good. The kailan with salted fish ($8) was flavourful with enough of salted fish taste and small bits of fried fish. However the service of a Chinese staff was a letdown. He literally slammed my cup of tea on our table loudly, startling me. When we feedback to the other staff, a nice chap came to apologise on his behalf. Despite this little hiccup, I wouldn't mind coming back to try the other dishes."
"Terrible place! Ordered through Food panda and the food we received were horrible! We ordered Kway Teow goreng pattaya and nasi goreng paprik. The nasi goreng paprik was full of onions, no cauliflower or long beans! Tiny pieces of chicken. As for the kway teow...  it was just omelette plop on top instead of wrapping it, the taste for both was horrendous!! Nasi goreng paprik, but it was just heavily peppered fried rice with curry chicken!!! At least inform the customer if it isn't available instead of just replacing it with whatever! KNS, fitting for its name, KANASAI!!"
"Haven‚Äôt been here for awhile and I realised they have renovated; thankfully the standard hasn‚Äôt dropped and overall, the food still remains yummy.

Ordered (pictured / not pictured):
- Big Prawns Hor Fun üëçüèª
- Sliced Fish Hor Fun With Bean Sprout üëçüèª
- Claypot Yong Tau Foo üëçüèª
- Prawn Paste Chicken üëçüèª
- Stir Fried Kai Lan With Garlic üëåüèª
- Sweet & Sour Pork Chop üëåüèª"
The best samosa that could get I'm Singapore. Reminded me of the original taste from my hometown in India. The service is great. Will visit again and again.
"Good Chinese food! Our favorites are the handmade noodles with pork balls and spicy fried chicken. Usually packed during weekend peak hours, and best to call to make a reservation.

Can be noisy sometimes due to the crowd."
Egg Pratha is tasty
"Bought the Christmas feast. The turkey was done perfectly, best turkey ever! The ham was also impressive. Only the chicken was not properly cooked inside. Overall, it was a success and my guests loved it. Will definitely return again!"
"Food quality is bad. Recommendation item from the menu is not available.
The filling in Black sesame pau clumped together.
Prawn wanton noodle soup is served warm not hot. Xiao long pau is also served warm even after waited for 20 minutes plus.
Tea is charge per pax.
services can be improved."
"Please do not eat here. Prices are ever varying and quantity varies from person to person. Food maybe decently tasting on certain occasions but in general the quality of food is average for the price.
If you want good north indian food please walk across to canteen 11 and eat at the Indian stall. If you are looking for South Indian options do not eat at NTU campus."
Best small Zi Char Stalls in Bedok to Satisfy Cravings üëçüëçüëç
Average food at reasonable prices. I am a regular of their fish porridge and rice noodle rolls. I would give the other food a miss.
Visited on 10 May 2023 for lunch with colleagues. The food is good and authentic. Fried chicken is crunchy but a little dry. And the kimchi pork soup with rice is fantastic
"Value for money as this is a what u eat is what u pay for but decent price. Western food friendly too your pocket. Attentive and friendly servers too.
Would definitely recommend to others."
"Great food and service. The promotional set is absolutely value for money with all the fresh Ingredients on top of its variety.

if you are missing Japan food.. wants quality, variety and quantity. This is located conveniently at the 2nd floor near boost juice."
Love their spreads and the meats is well marinated. Definitely will come back again
Nice cosy place
"Had a craving for chat... typical Indian Nashta craving... just in time for some papri chat.. and filter coffee at Raj Restaurant
I often pass this place during lunch and it's always packed by office goers... evening it's another sight altogether... chill and relax with a nice warm cup of coffee in the evening... totally worth it on the chat front...Also a bar serving after 3pm weekday... and whole day weekends... so you don't get too frustrated after work...wink"
"Good zichar carbs and drinks are aplenty.
Well trained staff.
The pig trotters bee hoon is shiok :)
Been here over a few years, Dungeon is always memorable."
"Sushi quality is obviously not the best given that it's mass produced within a neighborhood setting. However, there was surprisingly a large variety of affordable sushi. At night before closing, there is also a 20% clearance discount, making it even better a deal."
"Wow great value for money seafood shop;
We ordered 500g fresh prawn; a fish; and some other dishes for 4 people; great wok hey and the food service was pretty fast (almost within the first 10min after ordering)
Definitely would come back for more of the fresh prawns
‚Äî‚Äî
Adding new photos as we come back"
We had a really lovely and delicious meal here. Food was tasty and we all enjoyed our meals. They have huge fans to keep it really windy even though we're seated outdoor. One of the best thing was that they allowed dogs to be with us while we dine outdoor. Recommended if you're looking for great Thai food with a lovely atmosphere!
Very good experience and the food was so nice and delicious also cheap
"Good place , food is not"
"Great place for local food. A must try for tourists visiting Singapore. Many different dishes ranging from satay to carrot cake and even seafood and also many different drink options. Environment here is quite clean, but on rainy days dining in would be a problem. Numerous parking lots available outside. Prices here are not the lowest you'll find in Singapore but the quality is commendable."
"Staff were all very welcoming and attentive. Menu contained mostly of elevated local food fusion with western cuisine. Both Hainanese chicken pasta and Miso salmon chilled soba were quite delicious and generous in portion. Unfortunately, the cappuccino tasted machine made while the muah chee was a little too sweet and lacked the chewiness associated with this snack. Happy Hours from 2-7pm."
Very overrated‚Ä¶. The carbonara portion was small. And the calamari was soggy. Check out the pic and you can see the batter is not even well coated. I had higher expectations before walking into PocoLoco.
"Repeat or Not‚Ä¶Not. The queue was quite long around noon so decided to queue as nothing better to do on Sunday. The fishballs were on the smaller size but very nice and bouncy. The soup was quite salty but flavourful. I decided to splurge and get the $5 instead of $4 thinking I would get more fishballs, just got more noodles. Noodles were only ok. Nothing special."
"The restaurant offers scenic views, situated as it is in a park by the sea.

During my visit,¬† the restaurant was crowded,¬† though i must say they have a pretty decent system in place to usher in diners.

Surprisingly the queue moved fast and before long we were ushered to a seat by the window.

Order taking was quick and food was served in double quick time.

The food was only OK in my opinion although I must admit that the Vegetables in garlic sauce were good to eat and cooked well too.

I must certainly give credit to the staff and service crew who were quick and willing to serve.

Overall it was a Fast into the Restaurant and Fast out of the restaurant as well.¬† Pricing seemed really reasonable.

Atmosphere is great and food were nice. Especially their curry fish head and fried garlic pork. üòã definitely will go back again
