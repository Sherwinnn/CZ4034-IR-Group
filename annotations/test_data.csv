"Food is generally good. Serving size on the small end. Mutton, bind and palak paneer are good.  Butter chicken is a bit too sweet.  Naan is a bit thin, thus butter Naan feels oily throughout.  Gulab Jamun is dry and flaky for the first serving but the second serving was normal. So, quality is not consistent. Mango lassi is also small and overpriced.  Pricing comparable to other Indian restaurant. Waiter is attentive.

Parking gantry does not work properly.  We used various cards including nets, flash pay etc.  In the end need to use Paynow. Lol.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"My friend and I are post duty from work and decided to eat somthing before we head home. So we went to Sakura in this Eastpoint Mall.

The service wise is not I can recommend, I think they needed a workshop or attend a course for customer service. The staff is lazy to walk towards to the customer that wanted to order. And I was shock that the spoon and fork are not de same design ( it is understandable if you are doing it at home )

As seen on the pictures, no presentation on the fried squid and sauce, and to mention so hard to eat, and the sambal kangkong, was a lousy appearance.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
"Their food is tasty and affordable. We ordered their green curry, tom yum clear seafood, prawn omelette, nonya fried fish and prawn cakes. The standouts for me were the omelette, seafood soup and green curry. The portion were generous for that price so I have nothing to complain about. However I don't recommend their drinks. We order the Thai milk tea, green milk tea and the red ruby drink. Too much sugar but not enough body. Not enough milk I think and I am not sure what else but its really not to my liking. So just order the food and drink the soup and leave the drinks alone unless you are ordering the can drink variety.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"A Mixed Experience at Tapas Club: Delectable Cuisine with Premium Pricing.

My visit to Tapas Club offered a culinary journey through their menu of Spanish delicacies. The Seafood and Chicken Paella impressed with its moist rice, each grain infused with the rich essence of the ocean. Equally noteworthy were the Pulled Pork Tacos, featuring meat so tender it melted in the mouth, and the Mediterranean Salad, which was a beacon of freshness.

However, despite the high-quality food, the prices at Tapas Club are on the higher end. The cost is a significant factor to consider, especially when comparable Spanish cuisine might be found elsewhere at a more affordable rate.

Given the sparse customer turnout during a weekday lunch, it does raise the question of whether Tapas Club might review their pricing strategy to enhance their appeal, especially if they wish to draw a larger crowd during typically slower business hours.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Average taste with affordable price. Overall good.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Food was decent, flavourful enough and service is welcoming. Like the glazed pork, split wings and fried rice… e sarn Thai has been there for the longest time and the taste didn’t change. Will still recommend people to go & try",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Came here on a Monday at 9pm after my gym session. All the other restaurants were closing. The staff were friendly and my drink order was served very fast. My order of sausage and baked potato took a while but it was worth it.

I ordered a Beer-ga-rita cos I wanted a cocktail but it was Oktoberfest so I decided to have a combo of both. Overall a chill place to hang out with friends and family.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Expensive for the food we received. My friends and I dined at Don Dae Bak and decided to order the cold noodles and beef noodles, alongside several side dishes. The portions were meagre and all 3 of us ended up getting food poisoning. The only saving grace was the service staff who were polite and ready to serve us.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"At first glance, your typical Zi char stall in your neighborhood kopitiam. That is until you see the menu with dishes not commonly found in other Zi char places. The crispy chicken in the picture is an extremely difficult dish to find and it's execution was perfect. Now if only it wasn't so expensive, I could have it every week",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The cheese prata is very good. There are tower of ice teh tarik which is what I'd never seen before. One can taste the cheese, a bit salty to my liking.

Also ordered horlicks which is just as good if not better. Not too sweet and not too bland. One of the best horlicks I'd drunk. Definitely will come back again if I'm nearby.

Parking is an issue, but given that it is open 24 hours, if you come at midnight, you can just park along the roadside which most others did.

It's Sunday 2:08am and the place is full of people. Probably due to Christmas holiday tomorrow. Will definitely bring my family over though I live in the North East.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Born restaurant by Chef Zor Tan is a culinary masterpiece that seamlessly blends French and Asian influences. The high-quality food and impeccable service create a dining experience that transcends the ordinary. Each dish is a canvas of flavors, with every ingredient contributing to a rich tapestry of memories. The thoughtful interior design adds to the overall ambiance, making it a feast for the senses. After multiple visits, I am eager to return, captivated by the delightful journey that Born offers.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"One of my faves hawkers. Aside from being by the seaside, most stalls have great food. Very yum! Haven't eaten anything that's not yummy here. Faves are Duck Rice, Crispy roast pork, popiah and lime juice. Great to eat also around 4pm and sit on the side by the beach, its calming.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Went on a weekend dinner time, crowd started streaming in around 6-7pm, but there were still enough seats. Seem like the restaurant is managed by 2 staff + a chef (?) but still very efficient.

Ordered the Squid+pork belly hotplate, tofu kimchi stew and, rice cake (tteokbokki). Personally not a fan of the pork belly as it has a gamey taste, as do many pork belly in other places. The tofu stew was nice and homey. The rice cake dish was special, the sauce seemed different from others I have had. The rice cake also had a good bounce to it, but remained adequately soft. We were also given free flow side dishes. Enjoyed the potato salad very much!

All in all, 3.5 stars!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Liu Sha Pau was not ""flowy"" at all and some of the food tasted a bit stale.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Been here quite a few times. And the food is consistently good. Recommend the ayam buah keluak, beef rendang, dry laksa noodles. For kids, the nasi goreng (non spicy) is a good choice! I also enjoyed the pulut Hitam!

Service wise, nothing short of stellar. Every time I’m here, Ann gives good recommendations on food choices. However, today in particular, I brought the family (including a newborn baby) and Ann was particularly attentive and considerate to our needs. She even made special arrangements for my baby boy. Such staff should be recognized and I hope the management can note her performance accordingly!

Good food, family friendly. Highly recommend.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"One of the best restaurants i have ever been. The view is marvelous, the food is good and the staff is very nice... Just do your prior reservation and things will be good for you! A must visit place if you in Singapore. The property is well maintained and food is nice... Their 20 layer cake is a bit hyped but thier other desserts are really good and yummy...",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Pretty decent food.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Am a regular here. Best Nasi Goreng Kampong in town. Fast service, good food. Price ain't exactly cheap but pretty affordable. Vocado milk shake used to be good, but no longer so.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
Love the top quality and selection of beef and others including the prawns as well as the sides. Must say the beef was super just on its own alto sauces and sea salt was available. Liked the bipimbap and kimchi as well as the salads and cucumbers. Macha ice cream tops the ending. Good for families with teens and kids!!,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Good Taiwanese food at very reasonable prices.

Portion sizes are large, so two people can comfortably share most dishes, unless both are very hungry!

The restaurant has a quiet and cosy atmosphere on weekday afternoons, but gets busy at dinner time.

Service staff are attentive, friendly and very efficient.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Nice and tasty food. If you love spicy, come here!! Fish is so fresh that it went so well with the rice. Though the quality of rice can be improved.

I called before hand to book a table and the waitress was very nice to assist a last minute booking.

The Lala was not great a rather expensive so can skip. Vegetable wasn’t nice too.

As we order whole fish, sweet sour pork (super nice) and a few other dishes, we could not try the skewers. Will be back to try them.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Lea and raszy and Haikal was awesome made us feel like family. Even though first time here.  Service was amazing !,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Maybe ok for Sentosa but compared to mainland Japanese restaurants Syun is not exactly fine dining. They have some strange variations. Eg adding foie gras and butter to Unagi. Totally covered the original taste of Unagi. And they added a lime. Who does that ! The wagyu set is the most expensive for lunch. The wagyu is hardly marbled and came out cold which is terrible. The dessert is the best. Nice portions of strawberry mangos and a red bean pastry.,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
Throwback august 2023. We reached rather late almost like 45min before their closing time. But they’re still very welcoming. Burger was huge and worth the price. I had mine Build My Own Burger 🍔!!! Yummy 🤤,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"We really like meat balls, chicken wings and the mushroom soup at IKEA restaurant. Membership of IKEA family has one free kopi every day. The dining experience her is always great.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Visited the Holland V branch for my family’s first meal on 1 Jan 2024 and as regular patrons of soup restaurant for many years, we were sorely disappointed by this branch’s poor service. The waitress made snide remarks when my mum asked for a sip of tea and said that she will not be able to refill the tea if it was shared. Really terrible service, and the food quality seems to have deteriorated too. Altogether an unpleasant experience for my family.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
Good food at reasonable prices. We were offered a special slice of birthday cake for my son. Sirloin steak was soft and delicious.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"One of the restaurant that wasn't crazy when I went during dinner hours. Appreciate the great hospitality.  Took the 2 pax set meals which consist of a main - I chose the egg fried rice, sambal sweet potato leaves, 2 individual soups, chicken and dessert.

Egg fried rice was a little bland and oily in my books. Thankfully there's sambal. Sweet potato leave was on point.

Need to mentioned that the staffs are nice enough to top up my ginger for the chicken. Service rendered was also awesome.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Came here with company for CNY lunch. Buffet style. Not bad. Their service is good. Food tastes not bad. Price is affordable too. Will be back again another time.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"We ordered steamed fish and kong Bak pau for our lunch. Both dishes were excellent.

I enjoyed viewing the framed pictures on the walls of the restaurant.

Nice and clean toilets - love the hand soap provided.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Highly recommended!!! Because they are 5Gs!  Great taste, Great value, Great variety, Great hours (one of the store that closes later than the others), and even Greater service, where the team is always serving with a huge smile. 😁😁😁 Do continue to serve great food, coupled with great service! 👍👍👍",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Made a self collection order, upon arrival one particular chinese guy(phd staff) approached me in a very rude way asking 'waiting for what'. Your staff needs to be send for customer service courses. After reaching home found that my pizza wasnt fully cook and best thing my garlic bread wasnt even placed in the oven, its just like eating garlic spread on a bread. Will never order from this outlet anymore.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"It's a nice place to chill with friends, The price is reasonable and the atmosphere is good. Can play darts , keep up the good work n good food. Cheers",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Delicious mee rebus. The gravy is most probably seasoned with either ikan bilis or udang geragau, you can taste a hint of it. One of my mum's fav mee rebus stall. Nasi rawon and jenganan are also good. Expect some queueing in the morning.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Laksa is above average . Gravy is well blended with herbs . Chicken wings are crispy .,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
"Not efficient.  Ordered 2 lattes and corn cup waited for 20mins.
Coffee : substandard.  No coffee aroma more like milk drink.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"It was a pleasant experience at the restaurant, the waiters are very friendly and the food was above expectations.
The price is affordable and the speed of the dishes was very fast too.
My wife & sister in law was Impress with their Kimchi & I really love their Pancake.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"One of the best, if not the best, restaurant and the food was tasty and good. The manager, Owen, was very accommodating and friendly. Definitely a must go restaurant if you are around the area and needed a dinner for a large group.
Price is also very competitive.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The most horrible and pathetic Korean bbq I ever had! Portion is pathetic for 4pax at $148. Service horrendous. Restaurant is only 3 tables occupied during visit. We have to chase for cups, water, sauce, vegetable wrap! What a first meal out for 2024!",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
Amazing platter of Yu Sheng even after bringing back it home,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"This place serves up yummy bancan made fresh daily!
I didn’t have much expectation on this place. But i was left satisfied.
Would definitely come back for their",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Queued for over an hour at 6.30PM. But food was so worth it.  Padthai is sweet and savory, the crab omellete was so good. I can just eat rice with that omelette alone and be happy. Brings back childhood memories of simple yummy food. Tomyum was just okay, but still yummy. Could be more flavorful tho. Service was efficient. Will definitely come back for more omellete

Update : came back for more omellete and Pad thai for lunch. No queue this time.  Dry Green curry chicken was sooo yummy but too much skin and fat imo.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The service staffs are very friendly and nice! Foods served fast and tasted great! Visited this outlet many times and is really good. Do note the restaurant has limited seats, so do come early during the meals time.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Another one of my checklist to visit. We ordered the murtabak, fried chicken and fried chicken nasi lemak.

Foots was okay, the curries provided, fish and the dhal were the stars.  What really made the experience good was the patient and courteous Nature of the folks serving in this place.  I am pleasantly surprised with such manners and patience. 👍😊",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"we enjoyed the claypot pork belly with salted fish ($16.80++) which was very flavourful and perfect with rice! mala vegetables also had a good spicy kick. a little pricey and average ambience and interior, but a tasty meal!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Pleasant encounter! Good Masala dosa at reasonable price.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The food is nice and affordable, but I saw hair on my food 😂 their staffs should use hairnet tho. Only 2 star from me 😅",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Pleasantly surprised with the food here. The food is so good and flavorful. The staff are very accomodating. There's a lot in their menu, so it is best to bring someone familiar with the cuisine or can ask the staff for recommendations. They are mostly known for their skewers but their cooked dishes are also great!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
"Awesome Thai food here and the long Q proves it. They don’t take reservation so have to be there early or be prepared to wait. Quality of food was top notch and definitely good value for the price. Crab Omelette was exceptional, as was the Tom Yum Goong and Pandan Chicken. Service was quite quick and attentive.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Pricey but you get high quality food and great service. They have a good selection but not overwhelming. Try the noodles and the xiao long bao. Go for the Sichuan spicy wonton in red oil. They are a must try.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Selling curry chicken noodle but no potatoes. Upon asking. Staff said that doesn't comes with potatoes. Funny thing is that the picture shows come with potatoes 🥔 lol. If you don't have any more potatoes just say so earlier when the customer is ordering. Spoils the entire experience. Comes with 3 miserable piece of chicken and 2 thin Taopok slice. Slow claps.... don't waste your time here, even the roast pork seems to look good. Don't even want to try it anymore.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
This was the first time I went back to this restaurant in 2 years to give it another chance after finding a rice weevil worm in their rice. This time I tried to avoid the rice and got butter chicken and prata but still found 2 larvae in my food. I found 2 and stopped eating and threw the food away so there is a chance there were more larvae in my food too. Safe to say I will not be returning for a third time.,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Kudos to the New staff Patrick. At Westgate branch. He served us today. 23rd Feb, evening dinner.He was diligent to serve us. I signalled to another waiter but he ignored me. But Patrick saw us from behind and came to our attention. The other waiter seem to not care for our service. So I appreciate Patrick's attention to us that evening. Keep it up",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"An extraordinary Japanese restaurant close to our hearts. The seafood is impeccably fresh, and you absolutely must indulge in their grilled hamachi and succulent oysters.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"We went to Canton Paradise bedok mall on a weekday afternoon to take advantage of their 40% off promotion for dim sum and noodles. However, we were frustrated by the service and the waiting time. The restaurant was very crowded with a very loud elderly crowd and the wait staff were slow and inattentive. I had to wait for more than 20 minutes to get my food. The only redeeming factor was that the food was yummy. The dim sum was fresh and juicy, and the noodles was authentically 'Hong Kong' and flavorful.  We enjoyed the food, but not so much the experience. This particular outlet needs to improve their service and efficiency, especially during peak hours.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The waiter got the wrong order (without even writing it down -  apparently, he did try to offer with another item when he was taking order, but i wasn't aware of it, nor did i recall any explanation why it was swapped).
Drinks somehow took longer to come out (we ordered coffee and chocolate, which should've been easy enough since it's just using coffee machine).
Bill somehow also took a while to get processed; i had to walk over and ask again for it, so that i can make the payment.

On another note, the pizza is pretty decent.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"This is the best vegetarian restaurant I’ve ever been to. The vegetarian food don’t taste like vegetarian at all!

We ordered some dishes. Here are a few that I found exceptional.
1) fish: it doesn’t taste like the typical mock meat that you eat outside and the texture really taste as if it’s like a real fish, although the ingredient is tofu (I think).
2) fried yam with sweet: this dessert is presented very well, comes with dry ice (see attached photo). Not too sweet. When I bite it, the outer crust was hard but the inner yam was piping hot. The balance between hot and cold was awesome!
3) truffle olive fried rice: very well done, like zichar style.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Carol was friendly and assist with my orders.
Service was exceptional
The staffs service was great, changing of plates was prompt and our tea was refilled several times.
The food was delicious and the ambiance was great.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Had their Chinese New Year Menu, all of us enjoyed the food.
Service was good. They called multiple time to ensure reservations and requirements needed.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Made a reservation on Thursday for a dinner with my family of 4 last night. The gentleman who served us was polite and immediately addressed me when we walked in. Good sincere service! The food was fresh & yummy & price was very reasonable at $9.90++. The soup was a tad salty but my kid liked it. 😊will come by again. Thanks.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
The signature fried rice is good. The restaurant has limited tables and typically not adequate staff.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Amazing food and price. Im a regular there. Some of the comments are blatant lies. Come and try for yourself - you'll be a regular diner.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Very small place. No reservations allowed. Fast and great service. Food is really good. Small menu but good quality. Garlic fried rice was good, beef tongue is interesting, rest was also good",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
We were here to celebrate a friend’s birthday. They have 2 dining sessions for dinner. One at 6pm and the other at 8pm. Advance reservation will be needed as it’s usually booked out. We dined in the upper level. Love the design. We were hosted by raj who did an excellent job. He recommended us dishes and describe the portion size. Menu seems fusion but I feel like the dishes got abit lost in the fusion. My favourite dish was the buckweed noodles. The food was well cooked and season but my biggest let down was the pork rib biryani. Rice was dry and proportions of spice and nuts were not right. I like the idea but maybe could have been executed a little better for the price.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Had my first try back in july.
Steam chicken was good with room for improvements.
Vege was delicious.
Drinks are good for the after meal.
Service was kinda okay, prompt.
Environment gave a nostalgic feel.
Will come back again soon for the roast chicken👍",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
This is my 2nd visit to Super Thai. I love how traditional and tasty their food taste and they are rather generous with the food portions. Food didn’t take long to serve as well. If you’re there you got to try their lemongrass drink as well! 😉,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Celebrity chef is real, all dishes are tasty! We didn’t order 寿桃 , they probably overheard we were there for birthday celebration and gave us FOC! 虾枣, grilled pork rib, 干煎虾 prawn are highly recommended! 长寿面 also very tasty, full of seafood, including big prawn, scallops, sliced fish, quail eggs etc. They will recommend dishes based on fresh ingredients they can get during your visit, for us, it’s the squid 🦑 , real fresh and tasty! Their dishes are not cheap, still I will visit again because real tasty! High recommended for you!!!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Review for South Indian Thali (take-away):
Average taste
1 drink included (I took buttermilk which was good).
Quantity of rice is a lot but quantity of other items like vegetables and sambar is very less (like 2-3 spoons). Was left with plain rice to eat in the end.
Also, the display menu is confusing, with prices not mentioned.
For the cost, I would not visit again.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Yummy and affordable western in Jewel Changi Airport.

✨Chargrilled Chicken Chop @ $11.90
Well marinated chicken chop which was grilled to give a crispy exterior but tender and flavourful interior topped with your choice of black pepper or teriyaki sauce. Dish came with a side of al dente aglio olio pasta as well as a citrus salad.

✨ must trys!!

"Their fried food are quite good. However their sushi are not very fresh. Servers are very friendly. Another downside is that there are birds flying to the tables and kitchen where they prepare the food, making it quite unsanitary and the service crew seem unfazed by them. Weirdly, don’t see this issue at the neighbouring restaurants.

Aburi salmon maki - not very fresh, can skip

Fish and chip - they use catfish making it very soft and have the melt in the mouth effect. The batter they use for both the fries and fish are very crispy

Calamari - squid they use are very fresh and soft, batter is crispy and not sharp",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Took their set lunch! Ultra worth, cozy, a little dark but if you are up for that ambience it's a yes! Very attentive servers as well.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Fantastic Food , enjoyed their lamb shank briyani, Chicken Briyani, Mutton Haleem. This is our spot for all lunch parties with our colleagues. I shouldn't forget to mention about the deserts Kulfi and Mango Lassi. Great hospitality , and always enjoyed the special attention. Also enjoyed the evening snacks many times , enjoyed the chat items ( which I used to take away to home as well), Masala Chai is best one which I must mention specially.
Office location is going to change and will miss this great food. But I am sure we will  come here whenever possible, and I strongly recommend this place for the tasty food lovers.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
First time try food from this restaurant. Ordered a few dishes to share with my family.  All dishes are good. I will come back for the mala beehoon. 😉,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Very friendly service, huge portion, price is very well reasonable and a WIDE variety of food with different cuisine. Although may seems like an ulu place, it will be worth travelling for their food. Addictive!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Pretty authentic sichuan China food. I felt that the food is not spicy enough and a tad too oily , but overall pretty decent. Portions can be bigger for the price",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"If I can give 0 star I would, Service was the worst. Asking for paynow no response and blaming on us because we change from cash payment to paynow. Second thing asking for 2 plates and scold me by saying you order 2 menu only for 3 pax can only take one plates ‘so many dish to wash, nowadays water is so expensive’ OMG. Food way too overrated. Please don’t even bother to come here waste time and effort. Sim Lim one is so much better.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"As with Tras street, the eateries are in abundance within the area and over here, the nice restaurants are tucked amongst the shop houses.

It was a business lunch and we went for their omakase set lunch and the chef chooses what to serve based on the pricing. We had the $208 set. Needless to say, it’s worth every penny. Every dish will be easily 8/10. We were served 6-7 dishes and you will be well fed as I was worried having to do another round of ramen along Tanjong Pagar after this session. :)

One of the highlights will be the uni that’s generously perched on the pastry puff and the caviar too.

The tuna carpaccio was decent but didn’t shine as there are two more dishes that stood out - Japanese promfret and the A4 striploin. The promfret melts in your mouth with a strong seafoody taste that anybody will die for if you’re a seafoodie.

I couldn’t remember all the sauces and condiments that accompanied all the dishes. Just too many details but they tasted wonderful and complemented each dish just so aptly.

The dessert was a panna cotta with wild berries.",POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
"Date of visit : Sun 19 Nov 2023
Time : 1 pm

Celebrated my mum’s 94th birthday here. 12 of us. Preordered suckling pig and the birthday buns.

Ordered 8 dishes : 7 dishes + 1 dessert.
The suckling pig is excellent.
Fried mian xian, yam ring and roast chicken also good.
The fried watercress, 大菜 the dessert yam paste orh nee soso.

Date of visit : Sat 21 Jan 2023
Time : 6 pm

Came here again to celebrate CNY. Restaurant’s really packed to the brim, people in joyous mood.

We ordered the $738+ menu. Started with lohei as usual. The 2nd dish fish maw soup came a bit late, about 30 mins later. So everything else was being delayed.

Also a bit disorganized as tables were not grouped by type of chosen menu, so staff at times didn’t know which table to serve.

Clearly not enough manpower and staff was busy.

Roast chicken was good. Braised mushroom with spinach too and the red bean sesame ball dessert.
Steamed grouper was soso.

Date of visit : Sun 30 Oct 2022
Time : 12.45 pm

Reserved a table for 12 in advance as my mum wanted to celebrate her 93th birthday here. The whole place seemed full.

Called ahead also to order a big pomfret about 1 kg+ and also the longevity buns - a pack of 18 costing about $40.

The longevity buns look beautiful. We are reminded not to consume the big bun nor the small teeny weeny apple like decoration buns.

Service is good : some dishes are divided into equal portions for us.

The Teochew style steamed pomfret lacks the same flavor as other Teochew restaurants. The deep fried oyster omelette is so thin and crispy that it’s unlike those sold at hawker centres.

A traditional restaurant with her loyal customers and above average food standards.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Thoroughly enjoyed the boneless mutton and spinach lentil dish. A must try if you’re in the area.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Cheap and good food. Regular lunch place with colleagues. Good for large groups,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
OMG! THE WORST EXPERIENCED I EVER HAD! ASKED THE AUNTY NICELY IF BITTERGOURD SLICED FISH NOODLE IS AVAILABLE AND SHE SUDDENLY RAISED HER VOICE AND TOLD ME THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE BITTERGOURD! ALL THE WAY SHE SHOUTED AT ME WHEN I'M HANDLING MY BABY SON ON THE OTHER HAND! NOT TO SURE IF ITS ME OR SHE IS HAVING A BAD DAY. FIRST AND THE LAST TO EVER BUY MY DINNER THERE!,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"This place is easily missable, walked one whole round of level 1 and didnt notice I passed by it... its ridiculous how its camouflaged by the other stores.

Not a conducive place to chat while eating as the waiters keep clanging the cutlery when keeping the dishes and the sound just reverbs throughout the restaurant.

Would like to comment how funny it was their soup bowl is even smaller than their rice bowl, which was already small enough, about the size of a petit woman's  palm. How do you expect people to drink from the bowls with ingredients in it?

White rice was so little, served in a small lil tiny bowl.
Ordered their 2 pax chicken set on the front of the menu thinking its their signature dish but the chicken and the cucumber are horrible. Not fresh and super dry. It was 35++ for that chicken and soup. Not worth it. Paid 77 for 2 pax for the whole dinner (included an extra tray of siew mai and fried fish)

At the end noticed people only come here for the dimsum. But there are better dimsums out there.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
"Came here for dinner with family. It was located in a coffee shop and most patron that time were eating from here.

The service was good and the food were above average. The cai pu toufu was good imo.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

"The best pratas in Singapore

Alot of innovative ideas for fusion pratas.

Tried a whole-meal prata the last visit.

Pratas are also crispy and good sized.

The Fish curry is also fantastic. Rich, creamy and free-flow !",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Place was noisy & vibrant.
Food is relatively good. Chendol was solid! However the Crispy Garlic Chicken was a letdown.
Nasi Lemak is above average,  Penang Kway Teow, fish maw soup & stir fried beef horfun are definitely good.
The service staffs are busy. So much so that they served the soup without sending us the bowls & serving food without cutleries. Understand that they are busy so we get them ourselves.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
A wonderful experience at Syun. High quality food and their lunch sets were of amazing value. Their signature beef with uni was divine to say the least! We appreciate the team who was on point with their service delivery and very attentive as well.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"We celebrated our 7th wedding Anniversary at Chaleur and we were treated to one of the best dining experiences ever! Food was amazing in terms of variety, plating and taste! Staff were extremely friendly and approachable taking the effort to check on us and explain each dish in great detail. Chef Masa was extremely friendly as well and even walked us out when we left.

Will be back for their winter menu! Can’t wait!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"I am deeply disappointed with this MacDonalds. I ordered a 20 piece nugget meal takeaway that comes with 4 tubs of curry sauce but to my utmost dismay, when I got home, I was met with 0 tubs of curry sauce. I called the MacDonalds to ask them to rectify this situation as I was really craving curry sauce with my nuggets.

They did nothing. Refer to picture attached (note: no curry sauce) I was forced to rawdog these nuggets with garlic chilli. Displeased.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Excellent services, celebrating mum's birthday here. Staffs here are all very friendly and helpful, from ordering to serving to cake cutting, they even sing the bday song together with us👍.. Food here are great, craypot crab with vermicelli is the best especially the soup, chilli crab came with bit of spiciness best to eat with their mantou, 冰镇咕噜肉 surprises us as its really crispy with slight cool on the outside but hot when u bite onto it, their truffles salad is one of their signature, great presentation with dry ice effect. Their 富贵鸡 is also a must try, full of ingredients like sea cucumbers, sea asparagus, scallops, fish maws and slices of Abalone, the chicken is really tender and flavourful, goes really well with juz white rice alone. Overall we really had a great dinner and celebration here.. Highly recommended 👍👍👍",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Prices inexpensive, serving Indian Muslim Food,  No alcohol served. Foods: uttapam, dosai, masala, bryani, prata, nasI goreng,",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
I found the information regarding what they actually offer lacking online so I talked to a friendly male staff about it. They mainly do buffet and wedding packages but they also actually offer ala carte menu as well. This review is more for posting their ala carte menu photos for the benefit of everyone. I will go back for the food someday.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Delicious north Indian fare, especially dishes from the tandoor - perfect combo of spices and smokiness. Highly under-rated and not well-known being outside the traditional Little India area but I have gone here many times (especially after visit to Kings Barber next door - also worth a visit) and have always had a great meal.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Food was good but pricey. Service was attentive as well. We had the 2 person set and changed the cereal lobster to Butter lobster and pepper crab and finally clam kuey teow and wasabi prawns. With a mango dessert.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
"Restaurant Ibid provided an outstanding dining experience. The food surpassed our expectations, delivering a truly awesome culinary journey. From ambiance to flavor, every aspect contributed to a memorable evening. Highly recommended.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"It’s the nicer branch as it is right beside a quay. Fairly crowded on Friday night but service was swift. Battered fish was the best, grilled fish could be more tender. But otherwise a good place for fairly priced seafood. Apple crumble pie with ice cream was warm, crumbly but perhaps need more ice cream to satisfy the sweet tooth in me.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"We went there on Saturday night without reservation and could only get bar table.
We ordered steak, salmon, salad and cake. Despite the not so comfortable table and chair, the food was very good. Tasty and well presented. The steak was tender and juicy. Really loves the salmon. And the service also very good. Overall, good experience and will definitely come back.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Brought my wife to Taverna Greka Restaurant and I must say, it was an experience beyond compare. From the moment we stepped in, the ambiance was warm and inviting, setting the stage for a memorable evening - I had made a reservation for balcony seating. It is decorated with greenery & flowers decorated along with soft warm lighting added a touch of romance to the whole dinning experience.

We ordered each a 5 course dinner set. Each dish was a masterpiece of flavor and presentation, showcasing the culinary expertise of the chefs.

What set this restaurant apart was also their thoughtful attention to detail, especially when it came to celebrating birthdays. Not only did they provide delicious complimentary desserts, but they also went above and beyond to make the birthday celebration truly special for my wife.

Lewis & staff not only ensured that our dining experience was impeccable but took great picture and frame it up as a gift for us. He also led us to a picturesque spot nearby for some unforgettable birthday photos, and even emailed us the pictures. His hospitality truly added an extra layer of delight to our evening!

Taverna Greka not only serves excellent food but also goes the extra mile to make every occasion unforgettable. Will return to try the rest of the menu.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"We went there for having dinner nobody even bothered for taking order even after waiting for 10+ minutes, the staff were taking order dor other tables but didn’t give any attention towards us, hungry, waiting for food but no other option so we walked out of the restaurant…",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Had a good time catching up with the live World Cup match.
Friendly place. Decent food and drinks options.
They are open till midnight but last order is around 22:30.

Although the menu is good, the food is quite alright . I’d prefer them to work on the mint chutney, as it wasn’t very authentic. The chilli-pakoras are must try though.
Pool tables are available for pay-to-play.
Toilets are clean.
They have outdoor options.

Location wise , quite accessible too . Family and kid friendly atmosphere too .

Ambar, who works there was quite helpful and would come over and have a chat with the customers . Great staff !",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
"Was recommended to dine here, I must say I was rather impressed by the quality and portion.  All our orders are well divided before being brought to us, portion was really generous and filling.

Really love the truffle uni capellini, and the service standards of service staff. Tiramisu (baileys) gals alittle short of my expectation and I feel can be better, but otherwise the rest of the food were great!

Will recommend to call in for a reservation.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Waited in line to eat here. When it was our turn, we were led to a bar in the back of another area across the street. We ordered 2 beers and dumplings… 5 min passed. The couple next to us (that was sat after us) got their beers. They ordered dinner, 10 minutes passed. Still no beers. Finally flagged down the host and he brought our beers. We asked the server about the dumplings and he said they were coming so we ordered dinner. The rice shows up for our meal in minutes after ordering. We ordered seafood rice, but this has chicken in it. I questioned it and was told the seafood rice does have chicken in it? I am pescatarian so perhaps that should be indicated on the menu if it has meat. Asked about the dumplings again and we were told yea yeah they are coming. We did get the dumplings shortly after and they were mediocre at best. I requested chili oil in vein. To make this shorter, it was terrible. We never got all of the food we ordered. (The table next to us never got ANY food) We had to argue so that they would take the food that we never received off. This was a restaurant full of unhappy guests and extremely confused servers. Perhaps we caught them on a bad night but I wouldn’t give them another chance.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Beautiful location amidst the Dempsey Hill restaurant cluster and greenery !
Value for money food
Homely environment, gives the feeling as if you are attending a function where the food has been cooked at home and being served by the host on banana leaves !
The fish head curry is one of the best in Singapore !
The chicken , prawn and mutton preparations are tasty as well !
Comes with endless servings of rice and lovely condiments till you are bursting at seams !
Try the awesome Teh Halia (Ginger milk tea) or any other freshly made house pour !
There’s outdoors and indoors seating ! Outdoors provides a nice view of the greenery around !
The staff have amazing memories, no pen paper , and all orders are taken by “brain work” and service is delivered without mistakes and with lot of care ! They are very helpful and patient in assisting with ordering as well and will not misguide or make you over order !
Love the overall experience here and keep going back !",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Great crispy lamb and beef dishes. Rices a little expensive (2 SGD per person). Staffs looks very busy due to heavy load of delivery food. But generally it’s a good place to have you lunch.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Delicious dim sums with ample choice. Surprisingly plenty of vegetarian choices available too. Water is charged but tea is topped with hot water as often as you want. The food arrived fast and was piping hot. Service was friendly and efficient. Highly recommend for a good family meal. There is something for everyone. Fair warning - the chocolate ducks have runny and very drippy chocolate sauce!,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
"We had nasi goreng kampung, mee kuah, maggie goreng, mutton soup & paani puri. It was above average than most I’ve had before. Don’t mind coming back again. 👍🏼",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Cool ambience with a pool table and varieties of alcohol. Finger foods are available. Ideal place for chat and discussions after a busy schedule.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Nice view of the river and food is quite tasty! Worth the money if you are into the view.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Always come here for the fish head option. Tried both kind, Assam & curry…quite good. It’s very flavourful and strong which we prefer. The ingredients is plentiful and the size of the fish head is pretty reasonable for the price we paid for. Just a fish head is good for 3 pax of average eater. Will try the mix Assam and curry the next time round.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
We threw a party at this restaurant. Our guests wouldn't stop raving about the food. Thanks Vir and team!,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"“Best lunch ever” was the comment from my kids. Ordered hotpot and katsu set, everything was amazing, including the price!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"1 hour plus waiting for the pizza, and suddenly they are serving pizza to other patron that came in way after us. When we enquired about our food, the staff just retorted with a rude manner ""We are busy"", and when we asked about recommendation they simply said ""Dont know"". Might as well build a vending machine here.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"One horrible staff; rude and expect the customer to know what to do. Serving customer with a earpiece in his ear. His business must be very big... need to wear ear piece. Other staff were nicer, saw what he did and came to speak to me instead. Doesn't seem local, male with ear piercing.

Saw two staff (one of them same as above) use their hands to take the popcorn from the popcorn machine... erm... at least use a hand glove?",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Great view with spots of shade during  hours before sunset

Ambiance : good music

Staff : friendly and fast

Food: food came out quickly ... Calamari ok, hummus ok
Could improve on the cut of the steak 🥩

Drinks : served cold",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Been here few times for the buffet, this is the first time I experience dining at the bar area and the food is great!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Neighbourhood eating house. Cannot expect too high. It has neighbourhood standard. The prices are quite high. Mutton $5 and fried fish $4 each.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Wanted to try the eel porridge but it wasn’t available. The other items tasted OK but not so impressive to make me want to visit again. Overall, very value for money. The prices were reasonable and the portions were huge, especially so for the mixed beef pho. The fresh spring rolls contained so much vermicelli that they were more a meal than a snack. Coffee was rather weak. Staff were friendly. Ambience was so so but it was good that Vietnamese music was played in the background. There were both indoor and outdoor seatings.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Service: 10/10
Ambience: 6/10
Location: 7/10
Food: 7/10
Damage: $80 for 3 pax

For someone who doesn't fancy Korean food, this place serves pretty good Korean food. Pancake was tasty and budaejjigae was filled with lots of ingredients. I want to mention the staff there was very helpful and gave us complementary seaweed for our fried rice at the end. They even gave my friend a mask because his broke. Well done👍",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Very nice. Especially enjoyed the green curry. Probably among the best I had in SG. The rest were also good, but could’ve been better if they were a bit less salty. Fantastic service! We enjoyed the lunch very much.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"A quirky little restaurant in an out of the way location, this place is worth looking up. 100% gluten free plus a whole page on allergens to help those with dietaries. The food was sensational, service flawless and they even helped us get back to the hotel using their own Uber app when we couldn’t get a taxi. This is a must visit in Singapore. I would recommend booking ahead. Thank you!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
We tried new dishes this time and surprising the rice crackers taste so nice with the sauce! Recommend their fried kuay tiao too! The crab fried rice is more of average.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"This restaurant is kind of hidden underground via a stairway outside the building... The atmosphere is nice and cozy, food was great and they served alcohol as well.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Decided on the 4 course lunch set without regrets! The staff were very attentive and helpful for orders along with the recommendations. Everything the staff recommended was delicious and glad I listened.

I had the Earl grey lavender w strawberry to accompany my meal, which was fantastic and wasn't too sweet. The Pork Floss Tamagoyaki was so simple and yet very flavorful with every piece. The Spicy Cumin Lamb & Mushroom Udon was delicious with every mouthful and had the right amount of spice to it (the staff compared it to mala medium spiciness). The Fried Mochi Bun was a great ending to the meal with a great combination of the texture of the chewy Mochi in the center and the flavors of the bun pairing the ice cream on the side.

The music at the place was also not too loud and had very chill vibes which compliments the environment itself of the restaurant/bar.

Definitely would recommend!!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Nam Kee is an 40 years old-school Hainanese chicken rice shop where it is located at Upper Thomson Road….

Food:
Honestly , it is not the best Chicken Rice in town. But, they serve relative delicious Thai-Chinese Cuisines. Among my favourite dishes are Sambal Fried KangKong and Deep Fried Tofu.

Service:
The staff are quite friendly and attentive. Ok… acceptable service…

Atmosphere:
Old school and nostalgic decoration, with its latest change perhaps the air-conditioned which was installed in the late 90s.  It quite comfortably to have my dinner here.

Verdict:
I quite like the texture of chicken breast - soft and tender. May return  to try Thai steamed fish, curry fish head and roasted chicken in future!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Beef is very very sweet, and they definitely skimp on quality to control prices on the menu. Good for budget if you want to eat sugar meat and rice.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Abit confusing when entering for dining. No specific queue on if you are waiting for take away, for collection or for waiting to dine in. There was no one to guide the customer. Look like they are short handed.

Disappointed with the popcorn chicken. Is cold and dry, must well remove from the menu.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
"Qualifier for my ratings, particularly for the atmosphere. While it is a casual restaurant, it was clean and cool with big fans blowing when you eat so it does make you enjoy the food and company better.

Foodwise, very decent renditions of patience food, especially the staples such as the putien meefen and lor mee. Comparable to other famous putien restaurants. Where it does not fare as well would be other dishes which I think not be particularly representative of putien food, but I may be wrong...

Service was polite and prompt. Definitely worth a visit if you stay in the east and craves for putien food. Price wise, acceptable for the settings.

Definite plus point would be the open air gantry parking right outside the restaurant.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The menu here is intimidating because it contains Indian, Thai, Indonesian, and Chinese options. However, this being a halal restaurant with all the cooks appearing Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan, or Bangladeshi, I chose the Indian dishes. I enjoyed my food and drinks and hope to re-visit. (August 2022)",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
We celebrated my niece birthday and as we had quite a few people we were given a room which provides the privacy. Service was attentive and the bbq was done before they serve.  So we do not leave the place smelling like bbq. Plus a huge variety of banchan. Abit pricey and might not be for everyday. But for special occasions it is a good choice for korean bbq,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Very nice and breezy kampong vibe. Their menu was quite lengthy cuz they have pictures attached next to each dish (which was a very nice thing, btw!)
The coconut water was SO SWEET and my mum loved the steamed chicken so much.
Price wise it’s definitely on the higher end, but they do have a student discount. :)
Would recommend coming here at night for the vibes✨",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Been patronising here since open. It was good when it 1st open with service and food quality at expected level. Today was real disappointment as the sambal stingray wasn't BBQ enuf and totally not authentic. The sambal was sweet and not spicy at the least! The claypot tofu has only 6 pc of small tofu and can tell its ore cooked then pour in claypot. I am expecting claypot sizzle. I am always a fan since your opening but today i paid 33 bucks & left unhappy,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE

"Ordered prawn paste chicken, onion omelette, and HK kailan. The dishes were done quickly and we appreciate the speedy service.
There was pork floss sprinkled over the kailan which was unusual for us, as it made the dish too sweet. The prawn paste chicken lacked flavour, tasting like it was fried in reused oil. Maybe we caught them on a bad day as the other reviews seem pretty decent.
The eatery was small but there is plenty of large tables available.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Good quality of food. It was delicious. We had the iberico pork, dessert, squid, tuna, risotto. They were all delicious. Ambience is great too. The Chef even customised a “Happy Birthday” wordings onto my dessert as it was my birthday. Great service.
Definitely highly recommended.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Two of us had lunch here. It actually inside the Tunglok Seafood Restaurant. The food served was fresh and nice especially Sashimi. The service staff was also attentive and helpful. Great experience! Will visit again!,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Good food and reasonable prices. Pepper crab is tasty and steam fish well cooked. Will come back again.,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Butter chicken biryani among the better ones I tried. Pappadom so light and crispy that the fan easily blew it off the plate and I couldn't resist buying more. Will be back to try other stuff for as long as I'm still working in the area.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"We have been frequenting the restaurant for the last few weeks. It’s been a great pleasure to dine here as the food is authentic, the service is solid, and the ambiance of the alfresco dining area is peaceful. Moreover, it’s extremely value for money. Definitely recommend you giving this place a try.

Our family favorites are pan-fried sea-bass, the calzone (upon request), and the homemade tagliatelle pasta dishes. The ingredients are authentic and unpretentious, and are ultimately comforting. Oh, and the desserts (tiramisu and molten-lava cakes) are delectable as well.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
This super affordable Tze char has the best sweet and sour pork rice ever. Beats the top restaurants flat with this single dish. 😊,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Very nice new Indian shop in this area. Must try “Ghee Masala Dosai”,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Without a doubt the best meal I ate in my entire time in Singapore. This was despite the fact that I was eating from a set menu which perhaps didn't represent my natural taste. Every course was delicious. The scallops were of particular note. Perfectly cooked. The sous vide pork is unmissable and comes beautifully presented with edible flowers. Staff were impeccable and of course one is looking out on the beautiful tropical surroundings of Espa. Recommend.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Tuesday lunch. We had signature claypot chicken, egg omelette and 2 dishes of vegitables. The claypot chicken was delivered boiling like magma:) I’d love to know how they can make chicken so tender. Their service is swift and  friendly",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"A cozy authentic Chinese restaurant in New Upper Changi Road. Value for money. Ordered sliced pork strips with green capsicum n 5 sticks of beef BBQ , goes well with a small bowl of rice.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"1st visit.  Didn't want to get messy and avoided items that need to be deshell.
Food - Good. Unique dish like Truffle Ice Plant Salad, Chilled & Crispy Sweet & Sour Pork. The Ice Cream (with Mao Tai) is unique, too (the serving can be better)
Good service. However, the place can be noisy.
Will visit in the future to try the crab dishes.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
I have ordered the Xiao Long Bao here twice now. It’s the only time I have ever tried it- thought it was really nice though. I have just ordered some from a dumpling place here in Australia and it has made me realise just how good the ones from Crystal Jade really were! I need to go back to Singapore so I can have them again!!,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Delectable authentic chinese restaurant cuisine at pocket friendly prices! Tried this place after walking past a few times and saw crowd on Friday and weekend nights.
I enjoyed all three dishes that I ordered! The grilled fish had the right amount of spiciness and saltiness, lots of vege, beansprout and beancurd skin inside, stir fry vege in garlic was fragrant and the 饺子 was flavourful.
Snow brand beer only $4.50 and do try out their imported Wahaha yogurt drinks to cool down from the spices!
No GST nor service charges, staff were friendly and accommodating, free wifi even. A hidden gem in Macpherson!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Wanted to try due to the superior rating.
However I would say do not expect too much.

The place has a nice atmosphere, with some hipster touch
Food wise, portions were good and filling for us. However I would say nothing amazing, but it is a comfortable meal.

Drinks were not bad but the strawberry flavours had a fake flavouring taste.

Lava cake was pretty good.

Tom yum seafood pasta was also decent and portions was filling. Might be abit spicy for some",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Nice food especially the chickpea n the nans but the chicken bryani is abit disappointing as it's already precook so it's not piping hot.,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
"As a frequent visitor of this place, I find their food pretty decent. I just wish they would serve thosai and prata during lunch as well.

Nonetheless it’s still worth a visit!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"A recent dinner at Black Society left a deep impression on us. Ordered several dishes at the recommendation of Ivy Koh. Overall, a palatable experience, foodwise, as well as a pleasant dining experience executed by the waitstaff. A special shout-out to Ivy for her service excellence and great  recommendation. The crab bee hoon was simply on point. Thumbs up!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

"Generous portions, fast service and tasty food. Highly recommend the garlic pork!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Food was 10/10, very affordable as well! Loved the food, except for the kimchi fried rice I think it is a bit too wet. The ban chan was refillable and great. Highly recommend the grilled meats. Everything was good!",POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Excellent service espcially from Uncle Bob who made great recommendations.  He is frank about the amount of food and helped us order just the right amount.  No wastage :).  The service from other staff were friendly and professional.  An attendant was kind enough to inform us of the use of chope vouchers. The meal was sweetened by complimentary ice cream and after dinner aperitif.  The food of course was delicious.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"This zichar joint is constantly busy throughout the weekend and it’s unsurprising. Each dish on their set menu was delicious and we found the prices very reasonable. Our party of 5 had 3 fresh crabs, 1 meat, 1 toufu and 2 vegetables. The restaurant kindly throws in rice, mantous and ice cream as complimentary items!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Great Atmosphere, good food and the chef is friendly. First class service. We ll go there again. 1 for 1 cockage which is great.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Our favourite place for North Indian food. Great taste!!!!,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
White rice had weevils in it while spinach had sand. Duck was juicy but a tad salty. Food overall was not bad. Pity the hygiene was subpar..,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"The Spot consistently delivers excellent food and service. After a positive experience, we returned, and it never fails to impress. Kudos to the restaurant manager, Norman, who went above and beyond to ensure we had a wonderful time. His attention to our food preferences when suggesting dishes was greatly appreciated. Managers like him are truly exceptional and worth keeping!",POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
"Kaveri is located at the food court of terminal 2 - which is where I visited.

I believe they also have an outlet in the terminal 3.

They allowed the use of lounge key for a massive meal and a Masala chai.

Recommended…!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Perfect evening and food. Service can be improved.

Scallops $22, 4/5 - frozen variety but done well. Leek was hard to chew.

Pink oyster mushrooms $14, 4.5/5 - something like battered mushroom fries, perfectly fried (oily) but thinly crisped. This dish came late.

Veal brisket $36, 3/5 - meat did not pack any taste. It was a bit tough, but could be pulled apart. Jus/mash was tasty but could have been a bit more concentrated.

Tuna steak tartare $20, 4.5/5 - quite a perfect rendition, tartare scooped onto a flower pie tie cup. Four servings but adequate as a main in my opinion. Could have been more chilled if intended to serve cold.

Bombe alaska $28, 4/5 - mostly for show. Inside was dark choc ice cream, outside was caked in meringue and sponge. Tasted below average but the fire was a nice performance.

Cocktails were $16-18. Negroni and tequila sunrise were decent.

House pour sparkling wine $12 - quite impressive. Well chilled and serving size was nice.

Service: We came under a reservation which had an anniversary note (Chope), but when we arrived, the staff did not ask if we were under a reservation, and just gave us a table for 2. Luckily i did not have Chope vouchers or promos to use.

I ordered pink oyster mushrooms as a starter, though on menu it was a side, and ordered the tuna tartare as my main, which on menu was a starter. This, the waiter did not understand. I ended up receiving my oyster mushrooms at the same time my partner received his main.

Essentially the waiter served my partners starter (scallops) and then asked me if my oyster mushrooms was my starter and then that the kitchen would prepare it. Quite disappointed at this but they can only learn.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
We had the best green curry pork here. And the chicken is fantastic nice. Even there is less staff and we waited a bit but it was still very good. We sure come back again many many time,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The whole experience was just beautiful. The food not only looks nice but also tastes delicious, and the service is top notch. We did not get to catch the names of the staff we met there, but we are grateful for the service and would love to come back! Great job team Poise!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"There were so many dishes I wanted to try but did not have enough stomachs. Will come back with more friends so we can try the whole menu! Tried the kueh pie tee and hotate ceviche, and a glass of umeshu. Food was fantastic, service was excellent and staff were very friendly.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Visited for the first time after hearing good reviews from friends. Awesome ambience and child-friendly. Helpful staff who helped us with food orders and wine recommendation. Dips were great, octopus tender and flavourful. Desserts were also delightful. The standout dish was the lamb chops!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"WestEnd bistro is more of a neighborhood restaurant with community ties, and a warm, cozy, inviting atmosphere. Great food and really pleasant services. Value for money. A must place to check it out! 😋",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Chanced upon this place randomly for supper.

Was very pleased with the super cold Aircon and ambience.

Smokeless charcoal BBQ equipment was very effective

Only had 2 dishes as we were not so hungry.

Side dishes were the usual fanfare but very appetising.

Had the BBQ beef kalbi
Beef was so fresh and tender.
Really worth a try.

And soy bean paste soup.
Was super umami, surprised to find so much crab and clams in it.

The service was super awesome.
Will definitely be back to have a full meal.

Thanks.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"We ordered the Chargrilled Octopus (5stars) its very soft, beautifully grilled and deliciously paired accompaniments. Corn with cob (5STARS) is nicely grilled, the spices used is a nice pair to it. We also ordered the house made kombucha(5 stars). Came in a jar so it can be shared by 2. The wagyu steak and cassava fries are okay (3-4stars) probably cos they arent our taste.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Food is nice and delicious

Viru who is on duty is very attentive to details and provided excellent service.

Will certainly come back to Banjara again soon.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Ever since covid start, did not visit them.
Really love their Claypot touhua, chicken wing, blueberry porkchop, cabbage dried scallop .. 😛😋😋😋",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Good South Indian, specially Andhra Cuisine restaurant. Must try their thali and other non-vegetarian dishes (again south Indian specials). Its over crowded over weekends filled with Indians majorly.

Food was too good, service was quick, and looked little ordinary compared to Singapore standards at Jewel.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

The restaurant is a fusion of Korean & Indian cuisine, where Thevar & Meta restaurant chefs collaborated and created this lovely spot.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Great tasting and authentic dishes here.

We ordered the 辣子鸡，菜花干锅，招牌酱豆腐，酸菜鱼。

Strongly recommend these 4 dishes as we finished it all.

The 辣子鸡 was fragrant and juicy, first time we had such a juicy one, compared to most prepared elsewhere.

The 酸菜鱼 was also very savoury and generous in portion, but may be a little fishy for some people.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"a small cozy nook beside Tori-Q that serves really amazing dons!! I have been back here sooo many times to eat the salmon hotate don which never disappoints. Sashimi was super fresh and tastes really good while still remaining affordable. Really good for a nice meal out with friends.

Prices here are all nett, so no service charge! They also haven’t raised prices since GST went up to 8% so kudos to the owner for making their food so fresh and affordable for all those looking for good-tasting Japanese food.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Great place for Indian food.. affordable and near authentic.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

Super overpriced naan… 2 naan and small portion of mutton cost $17 at coffee shop,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"This place serve decent Japanese food but the price is a little high . Given the influx of authentic Japanese franchise in the island, the price tag is still stuck in the 90s (plus inflation). Well if you are in the area craving for decent Japanese food and is not willing to travel less than 10mins to orchard road, then this is the option for you. Set bentos for 2 person set you back at the average 70SGD . Overall is good quality but no wow factor .",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE

"Most horrible experience ever. Made a reservation on Quandoo, went down and they told me Quandoo made a mistake because they are fully booked. Our booking was for 7pm and we arrived at 655pm. There were 3 big tables empty at that time. Told me it was for 730pm reservation. If they had let me in at 7pm, some other tables would have been done at 730pm. A family came in later than 730pm and apparently knows the manager. Manager ushered them to the empty at the front. They seemed to dislike the table or for some other reason wanted to change their table. Manager moved them to another empty table inside and suddenly we now have a table. What kind of reason could it be that when a family switched seat there was suddenly an available table? It means that there was a table available all this time? And they waited 45 min to give us a table?

So we finally sat down and ready to place our orders. Waited 15 min to have our orders taken by apparently only the managers can take order. But at this point all the managers suddenly disappeared.

There were flies flying around and I even killed one on the menu. We saw someone’s Peking duck getting served and they dropped the cracker on the table. The waitress picked it up with his bare hands and put it back on the plate. That was when we know we had to get out of there. We waited 45 min for a table despite having a reservation, 15 min just to have someone come to us to take order. 1 hour for nothing.

Overall a very bad experience and will never be back without even trying their food. They blamed the app but it is on the restaurant to at least have the courtesy to call the patrons and let them know? It is Mother’s Day and everywhere else is fully booked. Where do they expect us to get a table?",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"All the pork barbeque are nice. Cold noodle, Kimchi Pancake, all the side dishes, cucumber kimchi, royal kimchi, steamed egg are nice. But for side Kimchi, it would be better if it is more fermented. Personal opinion only.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"I’ve been here for a couple of times and food is really good, staffs are also really nice, friendly and helpful. Nice place to hang out with your family and friends!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
This is a great alternative to the other restaurant nearby Love their flavourful fish soup and the chicken cutlet was crispy. Highly recommend this seafood restaurant with more than 30 years of experience Chef. If you are lucky you can watch their staff prepare the Giant Grouper fish it is as big as 2 human size,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

"Very excellent nasi padang.  We had rendang. Ikan sepat, sambal goreng penatin and sayor duri and brinjal. The cost is $14.00 for 2 person. The rendang was very good and the chilli padi lemah is very good. The staff are friendly and helpful. Service is very good. Sure I will recommend my friends.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Went for the $65 curry fish head set meal that comes with the following
- 1 curry fish head
- 1 meat (choose between 2 options)
- 1 beancurd dish (choose between 2 options )
- 1 veggie (choose between 2 options)
- 3 white rice

Overall the food is great and very delicious.

The service can be a bit slow (probably due to the lack of staff and it’s close to the Lunar New Year season), but the food is worth the wait.

Will return again!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Called to reserve table for 10 paxes but when reached there. They said only have up to 6 paxes. The staff was rude as well,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
Food was meh but the worse part was the place itself filled with flies. Once food is up there are so many flies coming to ur food I forget how the food taste since I was busy trying to shuuu away the flies. Ask the staff about it but there is nothing they can do. Count how many flies were there in the picture,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Nice copy place for the Westie, drop by Thursday to Saturday for live band in the evening, otherwise you can still come over to sing through their public sound system.

Service and Atmoshphere is goof, food is on the losing end, every dish we tried taste like 7-11 microwave food but it's fine. We will come for the drinks and live band in future, probably order fries to go with it.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Had a really nice experience at Fico. Tables are hard to get so make sure you book nice and early. The food quality is good in particular the fried shrimps and the pasta are fantastic. The dessert items were good but not great.

The setting is very nice and a lot of effort and care has been put into restaurant design. It really makes you feel like you are by the seaside in Italy.

Cost for 2 people without drinks was about $100 a head.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Excellent value japanese alacarte buffet
Highlights were thick and fresh sashimi especially the hamachi, Grilled scallops, Wagyu steak and cubes.
Great service from polite staff",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Pumpkin Soup of the Day was a little watered down….
Garlic shrimp on the small bites was a lot Better than the main course shrimp
Tenderloin cube too salty and put the coarse sea salt to waste
Burger could be better",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Pros:
Great food and atmosphere. Love the chill vibes and the music goes with it nicely. Staff is friendly and helpful. I had a great afternoon here, reading and watching the waves.

Cons :
Food is slightly on the pricey side, preventing frequent re-visits. Would be great if power sockets could be provided as well.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"This halal restaurant serves very good tze char. My friend brought me to try their fish head curry as she thinks it's one of the best in town! Indeed! No disappointment! Curry is flavourful and rich, fish is fresh! We also had the pandan chicken, home made beancurd, pettai and kailan. It can be a little difficult the get the server's attention when it gets busy. But otherwise, it's a friendly family restaurant and i would visit again.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"A hidden gem of a northern Indian eatery in Balestier Plaza. Will occasionally visit whenever around the neighbourhood. It serves authentic northern Indian with a few innovative dishes such as tandoori paneer tikka and tandoori brocoli, papri chart and more. The curries are very appetising, especially spicy vindaloo. The staff are friendly and fast service. All Indian food lovers should try...",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"This is my first time visiting. The ordering process is through the QR Code, and payment is made after you finish your meal. I like how the rosti isn't too salty. The cream doesn't add much to the flavour, so you can just eat it with the meat. They do not serve complimentary water so do bring your own plain water. I would dine at this restaurant again.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Good place to have lunch, variety of Vegetarian options are available.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Tasty jjangjangmyeon at affordable price. Suggest to go early to avoid the dinner crowd as the place has limited seats. Serves authentic Korean Chinese food.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Food was delicious Italian flavours, but nothing too special. The focaccia with tomatoes was fluffy and fresh. The white ragu pasta was flavourful. Desserts were good too, only found the burrata gelato not to my liking although the recommendations suggested to get it. It was more salty than sweet for me. Service was amazing though. The waiters were attentive, even let us try the wine before serving in case we wanted to change it. The indoor dining space was cozy but very loud as it is a small enclosed space with music playing and everyone talking, so it was difficult to hear each other over the noise. But overall, it was worth waiting 2 months for the reservation.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"A nice restaurant where best of Thai & Indonesian food can be feasted. A separate Vegetarian menu with options of no-onion & no-garlic makes it a great choice for those Veg / Buddhist patrons. Loved their appetisers, soup, pad Thai & deserts … hot lemongrass drink is a must have. Friendly staff made our lunch special.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"This is tucked in a industrial area which is not very obvious from the main road but it’s definitely worth it to come as the Yuzu soup based is superb.. refreshing and with the fresh food and beef is definitely a good combination. A must try for their prawn and mushroom paste, fresh and unique taste. Overall price is very reasonable and the owner is very helpful and friendly.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Well accomodating to our last minute reservation request! Food was awesome! Except that the cold noodles seems to be different from the usual type outside.

And seafood pancake is better than kimchi pancake. Hehehe.

Lastly it will be good if they can be fast and efficient in topping up side dishes!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Really worth the hype and the crazy price tag?

Absolutely yes!

This is an outstanding culinary experience not to be missed. First and foremost, the food is world class. Certainly one of the strongest 3 Michelin star menus I have had in recent times. All dishes were complex and multi-layered in their sensations, yet utterly delicious.

I also really enjoyed the flow of the dinner, starting at the ground floor with some excellent choice of bubbles, first nibbles and the now iconic showcase of ingredients, before moving on to the main dining room.

The wine list seemed well curated. Apart from the obvious super high end choices there was a decent range of more modest options. We had a Savagnin from Jura and a bottle of German Spätburgunder, both excellent and great value.

The sommelier and the whole team were just a delight to interact with. Genuinely friendly, knowledgeable and obviously proud of what they are achieving at Zen!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Amazing north Indian food, butter chicken was creamy rich and tasty paired alongside chapati and naan. Briyani was also flavorful.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"I take personal issues with keyboard warriors that has zero empathy to the elderly owners

Ignore all the reviews that critique at the elderly couple service standards. Both are in retirement and working everyday in a F&B (widely known to be gruelingly laborious) and running the whole operations+kitchen entirely on their own. Cut them some slack. Once, the couple had forgotten my request to top-up the side dish, but you don’t see my throwing a hissy fit. Be an adult and try to help them so you can get what you need, rather than retreat into your own shell, not get what you want and whining about it later

Have more empathy. What do you stand to gain by destroying two elderly livelihood who are trying to make an honest living. Stop trying to ruin honest businesses with this toxic cancel culture nonsense.

On the main topic - food critiquing:
(+) Food is great, one of the best Korean food in the area. Authentic and reminds me of my days in Korea. Nothing in Singapore comes close to authencity of the Korean food I vividly remember

(-) Food selections are few, not a Korean BBQ place if you’re looking for one but sells Korean cooked food

Strong supporter and Regular diner at Parkers",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"First time having lunch here. We had to wait a few times from order time (understandable) but also between each of the dishes. Maybe it's the system. I would have thought all dishes ordered by  each table should be served before serving the next table. Especially when in a hurry, we could finish faster this way. But no, 3 dishes came out of the kitchen went to 3 tables. Chilli and sauces are self-served which is both good and bad. I didn't know so asked a waitress, She told me to help myself and she went away, so I helped myself. Perhaps she could serve this time since we asked. A surprise was the complimentary soup that came with a set meal,... 👍",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Tasty meats, dips were okay, but the star was the kunefe!! So good we finished one and ordered a second kunefe lol texture was crispy, chewy, meaty and the amount of syrup was just nice, not too sweet!! LOVE IT!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Came here for its thosai masala. Never disappoint at every visit. Pair it with iced teh halia(ginger).,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

Vibes great.

Pouring today so having a coffee inside, looking out. Perfect lunch.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Ordered Dum Briyani with chicken thigh n gave me rice that came with pieces of chicken with some sauce that has got nothing to do with a dum briyani. Asked for Dhalcha n was given fish curry!! Who eats briyani with fish curry??!! If you do not have dum briyani then don’t publish it n sell!! Totally spoilt my mood and Totally upsetting!!,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Kind of local zhi char but in aircon environment. Food is average and a little bland. The Belado fish kind of overly fried and dry. The curry fish is average, the fry sambal kangkong perfectly cooked  as it taste crunchiness ! The sambal fried lady finger with prawn is tasty. The tahu goreng was great and the Penang fried Kway teow was just so so... the portion per serving is huge and don’t over ordering your food! Great service and friendly waitress!",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Old school zi char coffee shop with good quality food at reasonable price. Must order is the hainaneae pork chop which is by far the crispiest hainanese pork chop I have tried.  The sambal tapioca leaf was surprisingly tasty though it looks quite boring. They are quite good with them soups and some were already sold out when we went in the evening.  I can't comment on the squid as I am not a fan of squid.

It's a nice, unassuming place to enjoy some nice, simple dinner.  The lady in charge is quite busy but very helpful and efficient.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Sin Ming Roti Prata serves up very well done pratas in a coffeeshop that has a decent selection of foods. Their menu is extensive boasting 19 different sorts of prata (whether they are available all day, I'm not sure)!

Ordered 1 egg and 1 kosong today and paid $3.30 for that. A look at their cooking process shows 4 people around the prata grill, 2 'shapers' and the main prata-flipper whom I assume is the boss, leading his other subordinate over the grill. They also seem to cook it slower, and with less oil used compared to other establishments.

The kosong was served fluffed up, whilst having a decent enough amount of crispy parts. The egg prata felt like i was biting into a soft pillow of dough and egg. Very enjoyable indeed! Their dough has a tinge of sweetness to it too - I would know since I have my pratas without sugar or curry. Honestly, they are one of the better prata shops around, and their daily morning crowd is proof of that.

Sharing the bbq meats and japchae. Meat is nicely done and japchae is flavourful. Portion is nice for 2 pax. Service wise is also excellent! Definitely be coming back for more!,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Ordered via foodpanda. Mala was soggy. Bamboo shoots are too old, woody. Not something I would order again.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Food quality is decent. However service here is inadequate especially if you arrive around 5 pm when the change of service staff is ongoing. Then the whole restaurant is served by 3 staff! Literally you would be ignored by the staff if you wave at them.

Even in the US store in Chicago, the staff member lowers their body to take orders just like in Japan which is a form of courtesy towards customers. In Singapore, there’s no such service and I don’t expect it. I just expect the staff not to ignore me when they obviously saw me.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"I recently placed an order with Phoenix Restaurant for a family gathering. The culinary offerings were exceptional, garnering unanimous praise from all my guests. The service provided was commendable, and the delivery was prompt. I am thoroughly pleased with the experience and look forward to engaging their services in the future.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Really disappointed with meal here. Also disappointed with owners response - why not accept failings which are obvious from the pictures rather than blaming customer! Shame manager wasn’t present but on reading response not sure how would have helped. Rival accusation is frankly rediculous and slightly embarrassing!
Pham Quyen restaurant did seduce us with lovely looking baguettes in the window and we relished the prospect of some pho and banh mi. Sadly despite the numerous baguettes and cooked chicken on display (see photo) was informed that as there was only one chef the restaurant had stopped any orders. I mean seriously no one else other than the head chef could put together the sandwich. The mood wasn’t helped by the 45 min wait for a bowl of average pho and minimal beef, which I was told was down to a very large online order. I think this place would benefit from prioritising customers in the restaurant and cutting down the menu to banh mi and pho - seems odd to me that ever since the old manager left they have decided to extend the menu. Would like to say that this is a one off but had a similar experience. A few weeks ago! Not sure will be back especially after reading mangers new comments !!",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Went to Kelly jie seafood for a birthday meal, food was great, very friendly service too! The placw is quite small, so best to book before going! Definitely try their crab beehoon, we even asked for soup and noodles top up (with additional charge). Will definitely head back to try their other dishes!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, with many sports enthusiasts frequenting the place. The alcohol and food are both of high quality, and there is live music featuring a beautiful singer. All in all, it's a great place to relax and enjoy good food, drinks, and music in a warm and welcoming environment.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"the staff dont wanna serve us man we came around 11 and there were no seats and my friend asked the guy but he literally ignored her so >:(

in the end we dragged our own chairs and went to the counter to order and then 10 mins later THEN the guy comes and asks for our order

but ok after we ordered alls good the food was alright. prata was bussin, maggie goreng was bussin",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

the tastes is ok, the taco not so flavoured, a bit plain; the linguine is tasty, good portion;
Chicken wings are very dry and hard to bite, feel not so fresh.
Environment & atmospheres: 5/5
Definitely the views and the vibe are fabulous! I love to visit different beach club and this one is clean and relaxing; pet-friendly , good place to take a breath from hustle and bustle life.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Perfect lunch fix. Great value for the Lu Rou items during lunch. Cool and spacious seating area to beat the heat.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Newly opened food place that served affordable and generous portion of halal food. My personal favourite dish is the mutton soup. Price is great at $6 for the amount of mutton. The soup is good for cold and raining day. I feel warm after having the soup. Fun and friendly staff who showed the love sign at us when we signaled them for help 😄,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Delightful cafe situated beside a pretty scenic sight! Enjoy good food & also the nice sea breeze! Come here at night and be wow at the vibrant night life & f&b scene! We ordered:

Seafood Mix Platter, Pizza, Buffalo Drumlets, truffle fries, lamb wrap and a few of their recommended cocktails!

Food were flavourful and we appreciate how generous the portions were and we can agree that the seafood is pretty flavourful and yummy! The fish fillet is particular memorable!

Definitely a great place with a good selection of Mediterranean food!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Ordered a triple meat plate adding an omelette and eggplant. Food portion is huge value for money but am surprise to see the pathetic amount of curry, (maji curry is a curry house rite?) hence requested for extra curry for an extra charge which is fine with me. The part i find seriously unacceptable - they insisted me walking to the shop entrance to just make a payment first before i can continue with my food. Definitely my last visit here, too stingy on the curry sauce compared to monster curry. I told them upfront i will give them 1 star anyway. Lol. Adios!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Can’t decide to give two or three stars.

Unfortunately the food was served really slowly on the day we went (Saturday night).

We ordered risotto, duck leg confit, an appetiser and two drinks. The duck leg confit took more than 40 mins to arrive. What was disappointing was 1) the table next to us received their duck leg confit before us even though they arrived later, 2) when it was finally served to us it was small and burnt. As we were too hungry we decided to just eat it anyway, but one of the staff saw the duck and offered to change it for us. If it weren’t for the staff we will be giving two star for this review instead of three.

Our dessert also took longer than expected to arrive (almost 30 mins after we asked for it to be served, even though we placed the order when we arrived).

The mushroom risotto and the appetiser tasted good though.

Overall didn’t really have a good experience.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"The service is amazing, staff were attentive and friendly. I ordered the beef moussaka, the layers of taste was amazing. The mushroom soup with the truffle oil is another level! If u love mushrooms, u will definitely love this! The Parma ham pair with melon is legit! 😋❤️ will come back to try their other dishes! The atmosphere is perfect for date nights ❤️❤️😉 ask for the balcony seats, it’s romantically decorated 😍",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Mee goreng is nice. Stall holder is also very polite.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Paul at T1 all the way left at C gate. The counter staff is gave a warm welcome and cheerful and polite. The place is cosy and nice! Definitely highly recommended  to stop by for a drink while waiting for ur flight!,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Food was okay. Portion was small. Definitely overpriced, especially considering the ulu location. Generous spacing between tables though.
We ordered 2 pax set menu ($60) which was corn cheese + spicy stir fried chicken + deep fried pork for two people. We had to buy burgers on our way home for the dinner again. I’d rather going to other Korean resraurants in the main road at Tanjong Pagar for the similar price to get more proper dinner. It is far from everywhere and located  in the hawker center building. But still more expensive than other stores in the better location…
The taste of foods was seriously, just average Korean. Nothing so special. Perhaps I expected too much after seeing the hypes in the google review.
The atmosphere was impressive though. It has a retro-Korean vibes with thoughtful touches of music, lights, and furnishing items. Tables are pretty well-spaced from each other, not like some Korean restaurants that make you eating squeezed by each other.
Oh also be aware that water is not free here. When we sit down and ask for ‘water’, they served the cold barley tea. I thought it’s nice as some authentic Korean restaurants serve barley tea rather than just ice water. Later I found $3 is charged for it on the bill.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
Very bad customer service. One guy in restaurant don't know how to speak with people and is not customer attentive. People wait for him for long time to give orders. Really very pathetic service.,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Ordered Onion Egg Prata
Best at 2am. Full of onion + crispy! The fish curry is full of flavour. 👍",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Fries isn’t crispy. The rest is fine. Gave a 2 star for service as there wasn’t enough service crew during a weekday dinner. Pretty obvious that they couldn’t manage.,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE

"wow, i had a really enjoyable dinner!  the yuzu-themed dishes were very good!  the yuzu soup and waygu were very yummy!

came here for dinner during less busy weekday.  ordered one Signature Yuzu Shabu Set with A5 Hokkaido Snow Wagyu and one Ishiyaki Hot Stone Grill (yakiniku) Set with A4 Wagyu.

the service was good, and the ambience was good & quiet.  the generous spacing of seats and the tall ceiling made the environment felt very comfortable.  easy parking right outside.

How come masala tea is $2 and also it was very watery and smelly. Do you provide Quality food for Worthable price?,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"I am going to say straight up. The hokkien mee is terrible. Cooked by an auntie.
I regret ordering 2 packets. I googled and was kind of recommended by Seth Liu.
There is NO hokkien prawn mee taste at all. Super bland. It’s just plain fried noodles that any anyone could fry. I forced myself to swallow half a packet.
The previous local guide who said the hokkien mee was flavorful probably hadn’t tried hokkien mee before in his life.
Try it at your own risk",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Tasted one of the best ""Nool Parotta"".
It is served hot and parotta has several layers. It is served with delicious Chicken gravy. Literally , the Parotta took me back to the streets of Madurai, India.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"This place gave me Malaysian Kampung vibe. We decided to have an early lunch here. The dishes were leaning towards a Malay kampung dishes (lauk kampung). Wide varieties of choices and the dishes we had were tasty, and transported me to some kampung in Malaysia having these dishes overlooking a padi field.

The simple and humble Grilled Cow Fish was perfectly cooked and served with savoury soy, fresh chilli and diced onion as dipping was so good (you can ask for sambal belachan). Very kampung style. 👍🏻

The asam pedas fish roe feels homely and the broth was wholesome.

Squid ink dish was nothing lack of spice goodness.

Sitting capacity is quite limited so it’s best to come early or just ask for a take away. We’ll return to try other dishes.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Beef curry is good, standard Japanese curry, not spicy. The $2 top up chawnanmushi is lack of favour tho. I think they just use water to make the egg instead of using dashi. Overall I like it, the curry is good. But probably won't come again with this pricing. Total damage sgd$16.8",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"I found this restaurant on google and I must say the taste of food here was really good. Staff, Owner and Manager all were really nice to the people visiting them.

This is the only place which is offering pure north Indian taste in north Indian dishes. I saw restaurants in Singapore where North Indian food was being cooked in coconut oil or I could say in South Indian style but here it was not the case. Cook here is really a master.

I was in Singapore for a month and for almost every day I choose this place for my lunch.

Must try lemon soda it is very refreshing and delicious.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Good for affordable and quality meal. Huge portion for our mutabak and nasi goreng.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Hot Tomato Bistro is a western resturant with good soup. I ordered mushroom soup, the Hot Tomato Mixed Grill and chose onion rings for that side and to finish it off, lemon tea. The mushroom soup is quite nice and warm, the onion rings are crispy and the meat was somewhat too hard for me. Staff quite friendly with them bringing stuff you need and the tables are relatively clean. Overall, good place to eat steak and other western food.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Gem in the heartlands. Portion sizes are great and value for money. Service was also awesome, food quality is there. Must try!

Oyster omelette: not too oily, was just nice!
Kong ba with buns: meat was slightly tough, but flavour is there
Fish maw soup: very rich!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"First visit since the pandemic. Needed a refresher on how to do the okonomiyaki so we paid the additional 10%. In any case, if you ordered other teppanyaki sides it’s easier to just sit back and watch 😂
Everything was good, though the A5 wagyu was pricey as expected ($55!!). The gyutan (beef tongue, $13) would be a more value for money choice.
If ordering other dishes, best to share the okonomiyaki.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"we had a pleasant dinner , one of the best mussel & suckling pig we ever had

key highlights of the food is , mussel , lamb , suckling pig , mussel was awesomely good , lamb was perfectly done & well seasoned  , suckling was so amazing crispy on skin tender and juicy mesf

service was great , something memorable is having a really cheerful person serving us .

overall is a really decent meal , would really recommend the dishes stated above  .",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

"Very Tasty food,",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"It was a little squeezy for large groups, had 8 people booking. So do not recommend for big groups.
Nevertheless, the food was rather decent. Pizza and tiramisu was great. Servings for pastas are quite small, and can be better.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Service is good here, a malay lady was very attentive to our table when we require service. However, despite the high rating, food fell short of our expectation. Description of the physical menu and menu in the ordering page differs which made us feel shortchanged. Food is pretty pricey too while the quality was just not that great. Presentatiom could be better too,especially for the fries.

Ordered the following and here is my take:

Lamb chop - tasty and well cooked. Mashed potato is well seasoned too! Do share this dish though as you might find the lamb surfeiting after awhile.

Burger - was ok but patty was not well cooked. Could do with more sauce.

Chicken steak out - was ok, not the best chicken. Note that this does not come with calamari as per order page's description. Please update!

Strawberry latte - just a disappointment. Literally strawberry milk with shot of espresso. When mixed, it doesn't compliment each other. Can't taste the coffee too. For $10+ after gst? Just no.

Spicy chicken and fries appetizer - chicken is not even spicy the least bit :/ would have been good to have chicken coated with some spicy seasoning powder or sauce.

Overall, it was ok but there are better cafe hangouts. Location is quite a distance from bishan mrt too but good if you want to grab a meal after a workout. Place is quite squeezy too so it's not wheelchair-friendly or kid-friendly if your kid needs a baby chair.

Would i come again or recommend this place? I'd say please reconsider if it's for a celebration. Casual dining is fine but don't have very high expectations.

Nice deco for photos at the entrace! Outdoor dining is great for bigger groups too.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Food was out of my expectations... although is lunch set but the pork chop was seem to be frozen and not cook enough. The egg was seen to be not so nice and the most ok is the sushi rice. Overall the environment was nice and staff was good. Need to improve on food quality control and the speed of food delivered...I ordered on 11:35 but I am only able to start eat at 12.02pm and in between the customer surrounded me is less than 10person. I felt amazing for this from Singapore. Think twice before u really decided to have lunch here.,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
The food taste so great. Just like having the Korean food in Korea.. very nice. The tofu is so smooth.. the teppan marinated chicken is really good. Dukbokki is in small plate but just nice portion. Will definitely come back again..,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

My friend and I came here for breakfast and we ordered prata. It did not disappoint. The prata was crispy and fragrant. And the accompanying curry was tasty. We enjoyed our prata! It was delicious!,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Had visited for a farewell lunch for 1 of our team member.

Food was great, will recommend the kebab platter (comes with rice) which was shared by 3 of us. Chicken wings were also great and were presented in Swish Kebab style.

Bread was also freshly made, as it was fluffy and hot on arrival.

Mains and dessert options were also varied for vegetarians in our group and good as well. Tried the Kunefe with ice cream for the first time as well, which was delicious.

Overall, we'd enjoyed ourselves in the experience",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Not ordering from these guys again.

Garlic baby kailan: absolutely bland and tasteless. They do give a good amout of kailan, but hardly any garlic.

Salted egg squid: so mushy you wonder if it's all breading and no squid. Turns out it's both. There's a thick layer of breading that's mushy and soft around the squid, AND the squid is soft it makes you wonder how fresh it is.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
This restaurant served nice Indian cuisine at Mount Faber SAFRA door step and member gets discount for meals ordered but the dining place is small so avoid crowd visit on weekdays non peak hours.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"I went to have dinner with my wife and a friend today at 8.30pm, I ordered curry chicken baked rice along with the others. My wife and my friend have already finished eating their food, pizza and ravioli. My curry chicken baked rice still did not come. I asked one of your staff who was wearing black shirt (a foreign girl. Not sure if she's Thai or Philippino, she was very rude to us. She said this to us. ""So you want to wait or you want to cancel"" I repeated again that you guys made me wait so long for my food and she repeats so you want to wait or cancel? Then she walks off. Not even apologetic at all.

Very bad service.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Second time here. Good selection on beer on tap. Counted total of 9. Good crowd and nice service. Will come back again when I am in the hood.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The food at Tasty Court never disappoint us. They've their special sauce and dishes which can't find in other Chinese restaurants. Due to good quality and freshness of their ingredients, their prices are on the high side. Minus point is the location and limited parking space.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

"With 3 men behind the counter and it took me 20min to walk out of the store with a takeaway Egg Mayo sandwich. Movement is slow and alot of time wasted.

Only good thing is, this is the only fast food in Tuas.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
The duck and chicken were very good. The roasted pork and barbecue pork were of average. The staff are friendly and parking lots can easily be found.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"We enjoyed the fish burger, fish and chips and also the Kampong fried rice.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Went to the outlet at one-north with my family for the panipuri but it's not to our expectation.  The filling is cold and the pani to dunk the puri in was bland.  We had other items such as rawa thosai, bhatura and ootappam.  They're quite alright but u can get nicer and cheaper option at little India.  The buttermilk and lassi are really good.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Vegetarian Horfun/Beehoon available.
Dry and wet options. That's the only options available for me. But I'm glad I don't have to go hungry after a great morning out at sea.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

Especially Karl. He was so nice and very helpful..I would definitely bring my kids here again..not just for the food but their service..5 star for their service",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

"Found amongst the highly competitive stretch of Korean food at Amoy street, it's seemingly lesser crowd is not an indication of their food quality. Superb lunch deals and at really good standards too! We had the seafood tofu stew and ginseng chicken and they were both great!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"I have no idea why the waiter at the entrance was so anxious, he seems overwhelmed with the amount of tasks.
He cannot control himself with the frustration on his facial expression, he seems too busy, all the tasks was delivered half way, for example, he didn’t bring me to the table, but point a table and told me I can sit there.
The menu does not have photo to provide reference, so I asked him for his recommendation, he mentioned 3 must try, but I can tell he is thinking we are wasting his time.
Apparently he is not the only one doing that, the other waiters are busy too, when we wanted to ask a waiter to help us fill up water, they pretend they did not see.
I hope Violet Oon can at least provide more staff to maintain the quality of service.
Good food by the way.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"1st Visit dated on 3rd week of April 2023.

Our 1st try Nepalese food and ordered the chicken Momo and fish N chips as good reviews from netizens.

The exterior appearance really looked like the chinese xiao long bao but the texture tasted like siew mai instead. The sauce slightly spicy.
Must eat it when served hot because cold already the exterior skin hardened.

We applauded their well done fish N chips and the discounted price for senior customers.

Definitely will be back again especially to try their western food again.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
"Flood are just not the best. Mee goreng are not well fried( not cooked) after I complained and they changed. This is the second plate. I guess that all they can do.

But their prata I will give 7 out of 10 and the hailia( too diluted) and taste the ginger but got no tea and milk taste. I will say 3.5 out of 10

Ice milo. I give it 9/10",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"The famous Chilli Crab! Leaving the price aside, the crab is good and fresh. The sauce is well done and we finish the whole thing. The price is daunting however. 1 kg crab costs SGD111!! So it is probably nice experience but never to be repeated 😅 other dishes (crab fried rice, spicy fried green bean and calamari) were ok not spectacular. The Peroni beer is good though. Really thirst-quenching!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Nice, clean and most importantly aircon eatery at very reasonable price. Staff is friendly and polite, serve to table. Portion is huge, good value for money!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Nice cozy atmosphere with a good variety of food options, from western to japanese to chinese. The oysters are great as well!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Nice place for Chinese cuisine fine dining. 6 course dinner, with tastefully selected dishes to go along with. Every course tasted well, particularly the cod fish and the dessert. The dessert came as a surprise as it comes with the popping sweet bits. Something that you won’t get to eat elsewhere. Manageable crowd and service was prompt. Will return :)",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Purveyor of high-end Catalan cuisine. The offered tasting menu purports to be an overview of the restaurant's offerings, but has some notable misses. Service is attentive, though slightly pushy, while ambience is excellent on a quiet midweek night. In all, given the variable quality of the tasting menu, I would probably recommend going for ala carte versions of dishes you are actually interested in eating.

Liked:
- Galician octopus and pork belly. Honestly the best thing we had, and is unfortunately not included in the tasting menu. I think it should be - it's an excellent and easily-portioned showcase.

- Of the tasting menu:
- Amuse bouche was suitably amusing: a shot of unseasoned yet highly fragrant mushroom stock.
- Salmorejo soup with jamon ice cream was an interesting starter, though I couldn't really taste the jamon in the ice cream.
- Of the tapas courses, the croquette and bomba were standouts, especially the surprisingly spicy and piquant sauce underlying the latter.
- Stuffed Cannelloni. The presentation (a single sad-looking cannelloni spooned over haphazardly with a thick sauce) is unappetizing, but it tastes pretty good.
- Catalan creme brulee was excellent and a satisfying end to the dinner, as were the petit fours served after as a nice gesture commemorate our special occasion.

Ambivalent:
- Of the tapas courses, the toast-based tapas (the jamon and the anchovies) had toast that was a bit too crispy - when you bite into it, the toast breaks up and gets all over the table. In the case of the jamon, because of the way the jamon is shingled, it's all too easy to end up eating a whole piece of ham with your bite of toast, so that you're left with excess toast and no ham at the end. Basically the mechanics of those dishes doesn't quite work.
- Seafood Fideuà from the tasting menu. Carabinero prawn wasn't the freshest, and the short-cut noodles themselves had a sort of rubbery overfried texture while not being as flavorful as they looked.
- Crispy suckling pig with strawberries from the tasting menu. The suckling pig is good, if normal, but the presence of fresh strawberries strikes me as odd. Thought it would be good as a compote or something.

Disliked:
- Apple and Fennel salad, separately ordered. Honestly very meh; the one-note vegetal quality of the fennel overpowers the dish, burying the taste of the apple. A dish that doesn't really come together.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Great place for sashimi and sushi. Like a marketplace where you can choose pieces of seafood and they cut and plate it for you at no extra cost. They also carry Japanese cooking ingredients which you can buy. Great menu at very reasonable prices.  In particular, their chirashi sushi.  Even their gindara is reasonably priced.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Pricey, big plate with small portion, there’s service charge too. Spent $40 for 2 pax for subpar hawker food. The food did not go down well with my stomach. Had mild diarrhoea with grinding stomach, even gotta pop charcoal pills.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Indulge your cravings for authentic German cuisine at Brotzeit. The menu boasts an extensive array of dishes, my favorite is their rosti paired with crispy pork belly, complemented by a refreshing Kale salad. A family-friendly place, they accommodated our needs by providing space for our pram, catering to both a baby and a toddler. The venue offers both indoor and outdoor seating, affording a great view of the harbor. Children are well-catered with their kids menu.

I’m impressed with the cocktail selection, crafted to perfectly complement their German beer offerings. This haven has become our go-to spot for weekend lunch outings, and the added value of membership truly enhances the overall experience. I recommend this gem for its outstanding value, cleanliness of the restaurant and welcoming staff.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
"Went to have dinner on 18 February 2024 as have passed this restaurant several times. Was totally surprised by the quality of food. We tried the seafood hotpot and it was really yummy. The ingredients are fresh and the banchan was amazing. Fell in love with the lotus root, mashed potatoes with anchovies and the homemade kimchi. One word “Excellent”. The Makgeolli which is fermented rice wine, brought back memories as it is reminds me of a Peranakan desert something like glutinous rice wrapped in banana leaves and then leave to ferment over time. I highly recommend this family restaurant. Excellent. The staff is super friendly and very helpful if you need some recommendations",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"For less than $30/ pax, you get free flow servings of seafood, meats and drinks (including Thai milk tea and ice-cream!). Definitely a must go place for mookata lovers. Coupled with the unique Thai ambience of the building, I am loathe to share this but since the building is about to go soon… don’t miss it!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Top tier service, staff were extremely friendly and insightful … they would frequent our table to check on how we are doing.

Food was amazing, presentation on point very picturesque. I would highly recommend coming here",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Beautiful and nice decorations in a nice neighborhood. Food was nicely presented and beautiful.

The menu was messy, they don’t categorize to appetizers or main dishes. Some of the dishes, the size are tiny as appetizers but the price is like main dish. Overall portions were pretty small and it’s confusing. Ended up 65 SGD per person but still not filling…",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"I feel they can improve the quantity/ quality of the food they are charging.

Ordered coin prata chicken set and it came with ""2"" chicken breast cube.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"They now have two rooms next to each other. We were allocated to the second one because the first was full. However, the experience was not so good. As we almost waited 40min when the food was finally served. If you looked at the second picture, the egg already solidified while the meat was not served. They seemed to have short of hands. Food was good. But the service really wasn’t nice. I had a poor experience although I visited second time. Minus two stars for the super long delay of the meat and the chaotic services.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Reputable place for teochew food.

Steam promfret is their famous dish. Didn't disappoint!!

Yam Orh Nee is smooth and not so sweet..

Other dishes are average but the coffee pork rib is dry and tough.

Was also disappointing that some of the dishes are off menu such as Oyster omelette and braised pork belly.

Service staff are not approachable. Service is slow during peak hours.

Portion is small for the price paid.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"I read through some past reviews, and it seems that their pastries are great, but as for the sandwiches, everyone has had a similar experience to me, overwhelmingly chewy and dry. I recommend adding sour cream or some sort of sauce to the sandwiches, which would enhance them greatly.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Craving for affordable Thai cuisine? 🇹🇭✨

Helmed by the same team behind Soi Aroy, Super Thai is a restaurant in the day, bistro by night 🌃 Spoiler alert: food at this popular eatery doesn’t disappoint! We had…

"A rare gem for Tzechar in the heart of Macpherson! Dishes were all highly recommended by a close friend and all tasted fantastic! As the saying goes, always follow the 地头蛇! Not crowded for a weekend but I doubt it will stay hidden as this is definitely a 5 starred restaurant. Highly recommended to try the ones in the photos.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"I want to be fair here
I came and ordered garlic Nann and butter chicken
They gave me curry chicken and refused to acknowledge their mistake
This meal turned out to be a salty curry nightmare
The meal was exorbitantly expensive and curry was at best salty poor
Poor mistake no recovery not a desirable place to come back",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"A Cozy Izakaya that transports you to the land of the rising sun!

Food served were delicious and fresh!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Food, service and ambience are all 10/10! We've been here a couple of times and everything tastes good so far. They also change their menu every once a while:
- Wara-smoked tuna: 5⭐
Fresh and tart, great appetizer.
- Roasted duck breast: 4.5⭐
Very generous with the duck and love the sauce and veggies. Duck is very tasty, but just slightly gamey for sensitive taste buds.
- Squid ink risotto: 5⭐
The risotto tastes great and the presentation is super cute. Veggie puree at the side compliments the dish well.
- Tiramisu: 5⭐
One of the best tiramisu in SG. Very generous with the rum.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Went on Christmas Day and the dim sum lunch buffet pricing was $49++ for adults. It was really worth the money! Stuffed myself silly with many dishes that not only look good, but taste delicious. The ambience of the restaurant is quiet and spacious. Group of 10 for a table seats comfortably.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Good service provided here. Food is consistent as other outlet standards. Despite valentine day, there is large crowd and orders, staff is still attentive and proactive nonetheless. Highly recommended !",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Excellent food, great ambience and fantastic service from their staff. My go to place for Korean food.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The place is always crowded and could get noisy. Used to off their delivery apps as they could not managed.

But recent visit, staffs are kinder and friendlier. Likely after Covid they managed to employ more staff.

Food is authentic and seasoning is just right.

Also everything is a hit.

Prices are slightly higher, if u considered the fact that they are not a restaurant setting eatery.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
So so so so good. We tried the original fondue (delicious) and then the mushroom fondue (even more delicious). Recommend pairing it with a nice fruity light wine to offset the delicious and filling meal. Staff is helpful and service is super fast. Book in advance as it gets busy extremely fast.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

The food is delicious. I love the burger. The service is great too. Love the fact that they serve water FREE. Dislike restaurants that are so cheapskate and charge for still water. The sizzling brownie.... must try!,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
"This is how every burger shop should make their beef patty. Super juicy and fragrant. Bun is soft. Definitely one of the best burger I’ve tried. But i am quite disappointed with the fries, nothing special.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Drinks are a tad too sweet, prata is not crispy but taste well. Mee goreng is good! A chill supper place for everyone.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
Famous Japanese BBQ brand new opening in Vivo City! Went for lunch as one. Clean and spacious interior and plenty of lunch options as well. Went for the Sukiyaki set meal. Tender and delicious thinly sliced beef with lots of healthy vegetables and soft boiled egg for dipping. Will be back for dinner with friends!,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Food was awesome and service was 10/10! Definitely worth it to come by for lunch and the wine pairing was great! Portion control and timing took to serve each course was on point!,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The grilled free-range chicken probably had a good life running around, and certainly didnt skip leg day. Chicken leg was really dry and doesn't taste fresh. Mashed potatoes was probably free-range as well or the farmer never water his potatoes enough. But overall the food is still edible as I'm not a fussy eater, this is just my humble opinion.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
"This Penang restaurant truly captures the authentic flavors of Malaysia. While the prawn noodles might not quite match those in Penang, their fried noodles are genuinely delicious. Moreover, they offer a delightful 奶油虾姑, while in Singapore, you probably only able found 虾婆 instead. The cendol is also excellent and highly recommended!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Very good service from the Johorean Indian captain.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Visited in Jul 2023

The last time I had visited Rhubarb was 4-5 years ago. So a revisit was a long time coming. Good food and great service as always. There are 3 options/dining experiences you can choose from. I went for the most comprehensive one - 3 starters, 1 main with chef’s premium ingredient and 1 dessert.

While I can see how Rhubarb has been able to maintain its 1 star for so many years, I struggled a bit to find some key differentiating factor versus other French contemporary Michelin places. Good food nonetheless.

Service was really good. The dishes kept coming fast and I was done with my entire dinner in an hour.

All in all a very good dining place. If you haven’t been there, it is definitely worth going.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"A hidden gem for craft beer lovers.
The brews are daring and various, with decent quality and reasonable price.
Food is yummy especially the cheese loaded fries. Give it a try when you're here.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Visit Date: 19 Nov 23

This was a busy evening at the Silver Shell Cafe. When we made the booking about 6 hours earlier, the restaurant reservation concierge was not sure if we could be seated inside. A month earlier we had a quiet dinner at the same pace but it was so warm and sultry, I did not enjoy either the ambience or the food.

Today we had opted for their buffet sitting inside and it was wonderful!
We were served by the same Thai lady who had served us a month earlier. She was very attentive and accommodating.

The Sunday theme was ""Singapore good Ol' Days"" and Boy! Was that Good!. The spread was exhaustive!
There was a salad bar, cheese, bread and charcuterie, a small spread of sushi, seafood station with clams, scallops, prawns and mussels.
At the Indian counter there was a delicious tandoori fish  along with a reasonable spread of veg and non veg options.
In the live satay station, beef and lamb satay were the best. There was a spicy sambal prawn to die for. The roasted lamb was ok. They also served a coconut chicken ( don't remember the name) which was the tastiest with rainbow coloured rice.
On another end of the hall was roasted duck, char siew, olive rice, chilli crabs and many others.I cannot even name all.
The dessert bar was quite exhaustive too. The bread pudding was very good and so was the creme brulee. The gula melaka sago was a little bland in comparison to others. There were assorted tarts cakes and fruits. The  pandan kaya and lapis cake were very good
We had shiraz to go with it all. Wine by the glass was quite comparable price-wise to any other city restaurant.
Delicious food in a great ambience. it was priceless family time.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
Casual and fuss-free dining experience. Staffs are always friendly and attentive. Porridge taste consistent every time I visit. The black fungus appetizer that came with the set was refreshing. Spent around $13 for a quick and delicious meal.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

"one of the best zhichar in the west.
the place is not big and tables are limited tho.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"My dad’s favourite place for fish head steamboat so we went there for his birthday lunch. We chose the badang fish option which had no bones so that it’s easier for everyone to eat. The soup was sweet and delicious and fish was fresh. We also ordered their signature homemade tofu, prawn paste chicken (prawn paste taste is strong!), qinglong vegetables, clay pot pig liver and all were good. My favourite is still the soup. Will come back again but recommended to make reservations for big groups cause the restaurant is quite small.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"I recently had the pleasure of dining and take away at Nandhana’s Restaurant in Jookoon, and it was an exceptional experience. The food quality was outstanding, with every dish bursting with delicious flavors. The service was impeccable, thanks to the friendly and attentive staff who made our visit truly enjoyable.

One standout aspect was Manager Nadhan's remarkable responsibility and dedication. He ensured that everything ran smoothly, adding an extra layer of excellence to our dining experience.

The restaurant's welcoming atmosphere made it a perfect place to enjoy a meal with friends and family. Overall, Nandhanas Restaurant left a lasting impression on me, and I can't wait to return for more culinary delights. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

Lamb taste and food quantity are really great. Really cheap on what we ordered. Recommend fried cumin lamb ribs. Only the decoration is kind of obsolete.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"First time visiting..
Generally positive experience.
Pizza and Pasta worth a try. But price is on the high side, not wallet friendly.

Lobster bisque and lamb rack is a miss.

Truffle fries nothing fanciful - miss.

Service is average only.

Washroom available on site.
Carpark available on site.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

I had the lunch time promo (1-for-1 chicken chop) and it was good! The chicken was served on a hot plate which was still sizzling when it arrived and it was juicy and the texture was not too firm. There’s also a section where you can play darts with friends and I like how they separated the two areas so that dining section is not too noisy so that normal conversations can still be held.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Went to pizza hut bedok yesterday with my family to have lunch. I was amazed how the staffs accommodate us with outstanding service most specially from Sylvia.

"Food was amazing!! Octopus Leg is a must for appetiser - best polpo I’ve tried in Singapore! Pasta has good portion and really good too! The meat platter was best for sharing - the lamb was really good! Service is great, Francis and Jordan were really helpful and even suggested wine choice for the food we ordered. I’d come back again for sure!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
The food at this place is definitely above average if you are willing to wait. Be prepared to wait minimally 30 mins even for takeaways. Been many times. Had to wait for 1hr on one occasion. We were famished but the food did not disappoint.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"My whole family was a saffron's briyani lover.. I travel from the west to the east just to have the briyani but now the standard really dropped way out.. First, the order takers at the counter couldn't understand English & got easily irritated.. Most Importantly, the food wasn't hot at all.. when asked the staff, he set they forgot to on the stove for the warmer set.. The rice, curry & the chicken wasnt hot. Best part of it is we went at around 1pm which is lunch time.. So disappointing!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

"Had early dinner around 530pm on a weekday. The ambience and setting of this outlet is really nice and spacious. The booth seatings in the middle of the restaurant are very cozy and the way it’s designed, it still gives you privacy between tables.

Food is good, consistent across the various outlets I’ve been too. Mamma Mia is really a place you can keep coming back to again and again with friends and family to try different menu items and be assured the taste and quality will not disappoint every time.

They launched a new set menu! Limited options but a pretty good start. Extra compliments for the lemon parsley risotto I had today. Butter had a hazelnut flavour and the rice was creamy and refreshing at the same time. Very well prepared by the Chef.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
The overall food is delicious. The presentation is good for photo taking too. The only thing that makes me feel sad is… add spicy need to top up $1.50 but there got a spicy powder on the table. I really cannot! Really feel like being chop… i cannot give full stars for this !,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Great Indian in Sentosa cove and lovely staff serving. Delighted with this and well worth a visit.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Food came relatively fast with the exception of the Teochew olive rice. We checked with the server multiple times regarding the order but she brushed us off with “it takes time to steam” without even checking with the kitchen. After an hour of waiting we decided we had enough and asked to cancel the rice if it was not ready and it turned out that the kitchen did not even prepare it as there was a glitch in their system. The staff was not apologetic at all and merely said she would cancel the order while the other staff who took our order came to apologise as she did not check with the kitchen and assumed that they were preparing the food. This situation could have been avoided if they actually went to check on our order instead of brushing it off.

Edit:
They gave us a 10% staff discount to apologise for the issue.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Super noisy and echoey place. The sounds from the staff keeping and laying out the plates plus the tons of kids running around made our dining experience hell. Went specially for dim sum but was informed that they were not available. on a Sunday 😂 samsui chicken and spicy potato leaves were good but everything else was average.,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Honestly a lousy meal.    The so called claypot fish head is $23 and tasted so fishy.     I stopped after 2 mouth.     The soup within is starchy type  with 4 tofu and 2 tan pieces.  The beef hor fun is so so.    The sweet and sour pork is good

Not worth the trip here",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Affordable and delicious sushi! Every rice is coated with unique sauce that is paired with the meat/vegetable topping u order. Extremely love the pork slice sushi and always order it everytime! The udon was a little hard but I enjoyed it still. The dessert choices are plenty compared to other sushi restaurants I know and I love it!

Glad to enjoy a complete meal here! The service staff are friendly too and the I got my seats fast even on a Saturday evening!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

Many different stores and huge variety of food to choose from. Just sit down and wait for one of the servers/waiters to come to you. Everything will be ordered through them! Pay at the drinks stall after you are done eating!

Opens till real late too so its a big plus!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Al Hadheerah is located at the basement foodcourt of Toa Payoh hdb hub.

The ko-song roti prata is oh so nice and has a “crispyness” to it.

They have some promo value sets which are sold at a slight discount vs ala carte orders.

Try having the prata with the fish curry. Very nice!!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"I had a fantastic experience at this restaurant! The food was absolutely superb, and the service was top-notch. During my visit for lunch, I had the pleasure of trying both the chili and pepper crab dishes. The crab meat was incredibly fresh, and the dark pepper sauce was a standout—it paired perfectly with the crab. To end on a sweet note, I indulged in the mango coconut dessert, which was not only beautifully presented but also impressively layered. I highly recommend this place for an unforgettable dining experience!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"had an amazing experience there, with service from the staff being exceptional. came in for the last hour of the restaurant and was given complimentary drinks as well. had our food packed nicely as we could not finsih them in time. overall great experience with a great atmosphere!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The uncle serving the satay here was EXTREMELY RUDE to us. Don’t bother going here. He was grumbling so much throughout the entire time we were ordering. If you don’t know how to serve your customers nicely, just close your shop.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
The food is different from what picture looks like. No vege at all despite all the green in their picture. Not much ingredients and definitely does not worth the price.,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
"We got a voucher after dining in at Galangal Bishan (their ”sister” outlet), came to try their milkshake & cake. Very generous portion for milkshake. The menu stated “mini milkshake” but it came out to be giant hahaha! Love the service, very attentive. Will come back to try their food another day!

Chocolate crunch cake MUST TRY  - very crunchy not too sweet.

Ambience: very cozy setting.there are outdoor seating as well feels like outdoor camping.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Ordered BBQ grilled prawns, disappointed 👎 taste like light fry with salt! did not have any grilled!  $16 not worthy. Maybe they are too busy, have too many other orders!!  Not recommended!",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
Nice Dishes and Bbq Fish,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Had a meal here on Mother's day. Food was promptly served. Samsui chicken is a must-order dish. Soup of the day (lotus root) and olive rice tasted pretty good to me as well. Tapioca leaves dish was mediocre.

Do note that olive rice is steamed rice and not olive fried rice, so flavours are definitely lighter than what you should expect from fried rice. I liked it though, as it didn't overpower the other dishes we had.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Awesome dining experience! I rarely leave reviews but Sol & Ora was so good I think it deserves a shoutout. Tried the 4-course dinner set menu during restaurant week. Food was great with generous portions. Service was tiptop! Thanks to Nikolas and Khalisa for your attentiveness and great service. Great vibes all round. Definitely coming back again!,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Our first time KFC at Singapore. Tasty fried chicken, serve really well. Very helpful and friendly staff.",POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"One of the best katsu in Singapore! Go for the loin if you prefer something fatty, but opt for the fillet if you want a leaner cut. Both curry options and “plain” were amazing. It’s packed even on a Monday night. Worth a visit.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Nice chill vibes as can see a few horses at a near distance if there are trainings going on. The garlic clams with broth and garlic bread, fish & chips and angel hair pasta with seafood are good!
P.S. staff are polite and friendly too",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The spinach tofu is very delicious, there’s mushrooms, and gravy with some scallops bits..there’s like egg in side the Toufu...👍🏻👍🏻",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Food is tasty. A bit pricy but food portion is good for 2pax. Place is comfy, clean and nice for intimate dinner dates. 😅 Good music also.
Manager and staffs are polite 👍🏻",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Teppei offers a great Japanese Omakase dinner experience. The place feels like a Japanese Izakaya with the bar seats at the counter. While it may seem cramped, it is also very homely. The dinner menu changes on a monthly basis.

The October 2023 was a tie up with Nagasaki prefecture. The food is good as always.

The prices have gone up slightly since I first ate here many years ago. But the service hasn’t changed much.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Ramen lunch set is costly priced:) 11.9++
Ramen, side dish, drink",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Food here overall more at a salty side but is good if you are prefer heavy tasted food.

Paper wrapped chicken is nowadays difficult to find which is why recommended but the saltiest dish. Be prepared if you would like to try. The meat is really tender though

Environment is the old school chinese restaurant style. Building is abit old as well but clean (toilet is clean).",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"I usually eat at this restaurant mostly night times around 2 or 3 am. This time when I arrive around 2am the Chinese lady came out and said they packed already and closed which is obviously she don’t wanna accept me and my friend so I asked isn’t close at 4am and she said no, we packed and close now. I was so mad didn’t say anything to her and I just left. Won’t come again since I feel like her attitude was bad. Thanks ☺️",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"This restaurant does not even deserved to be called ""a restaurant"" and it deserved zero star! ""Hongkong"" milk tea is actually kopitiam teh bing. Servings all super small. Deep fried prawn dumpling is filled with oil and spurt out when biting. Egg tarts are super mini. None of what I ordered satisfy me. I think kopitiam dim sum taste even nicer. Staffs super attitude. I will not come again. Please close shop ASAP, you don't deserve to be in our World No. 1 airport. They called themselves ""Famous""... For those who think their food is nice, please go and try Red Star Restaurant at Chin Swee Rd.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"The food is good, but the staff not recommend the right way for customers, if someone order an item for one person only, they not mention to the customers regarding the portion is very big, just want customers to spend more money only",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"My wife and I were looking for a nice restaurant near the Clan Hotel.   It was raining hard and Mazzo was only a few minutes walk.   We ordered a pizza, grilled fish combo and tiramisu.   All were excellent.   The prices were good for Singapore and the Manager James was very friendly.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Walked passed this a few times during lunch and finally decided to try it with a group of friends. I really like the fusion taste and unique presentation, especially the trendy Peking duck, apple wood chicken and grand duke jiang’s carch. Definitely not your typical Sichuan food, and worth a try.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"It was rather crowded on a weekday evening. We went to this restaurant not knowing that it is a vegan restaurant 😂 food was ok and the servers were all friendly, just that they reek of smoke smell. Prices above average. Many tourists and non-local there.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"First time try. We enjoyed the food, service and ambience. Price was also reasonable. The photos show two of the dishes that we liked. The other dishes were delicious too such as the Peking Duck and the Scallion Sakura Chicken.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Food is really good! They are well known for thai, western & indian food. We got the pad thai & 300g ribeye - no regrets at all!

The live band, made up of the twins & a wonderful guitarist, was really good as well! Will definitely revisit 😊",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
"We always end our golfing day at this restaurant. Very high ceiling, spacious indoor seating. Outdoor seating overlooks at 9th and 18th hole with beautiful waterfront scenery and good place to catch the plane going to landings though it can get really noisy. If you are sitting outdoor, be sure to sit on the right side as the sofa seats on the left side might at times get hit by golf balls, though rather rare. Food and service are fantastic. They serve local, japanese, western food and all taste great! I had the laksa and was pretty good! The hotdog is huge, bigger than my face. Beef hor fun was ok, would give that a miss. Sushi is definitely a go for.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"I tried it for the first time with a friend.  I like how cozy the place is and the food is really good, I like the crispiness of the salmon and the quantity is huge for the chicken cutlet with melted cheese. It was delicious, my friend was so in awe that I found this place as it was located in a quite deserted area. The vanilla latte is quite nice too.
Will definitely come back to enjoy this.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"A cozy cafe with very friendly staff who make the effort to get to know you. The cold brew is good and so is the coffee jelly that’s specially made by the lady boss who had stayed in Japan for 10 years.
Weekday lunches may have rice bowls which are really yummy.
On weekend evenings, this place is transformed and turned into cozy bar that serves classic cocktails. Follow them on Instagram for updates.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Still one of the very exceptional Zi char stalls around if you got the patience of 45 mins.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"I would say the food isnt authentic Korean as its tagline. Taste was ok, Bulgogi beef was charred at the bottom. Bibimbap was good, Ramyeon was ok.

Good views from the restaurant",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Fried rice was decent but could use more wokhey. But no idea why it was not hot when I ate there. The mapo dofu on the other hand was great and piping hot.,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
"Drinks are unique. Love their bar bites. Price is ok.

Great to unwind after a long day and see the planes land.

Service is good.  Would return again.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Ordered prawn kway teow dry with chilli. They added black soya sauce into the dish which makes it a bit sweet. The chilli is spicy. The soup is thick and flavourful. The pork slices are a bit hard and not tender. It would be better if they remove the black soya sauce.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"We like the service of Kay.very polite and helpful.
Gd service.
We like her very much",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"<ö+ TasteMarked Reviews +ø>
Experience not very good. I came here during lunch hour with colleagues. Food tasted very plain, shrimp not fresh, steam fish over cooked, soup over-powered by Chinese cooking wine taste. Most important of all - serving speed is extremely slow (we are just one of the 3 tables), and both our table and the table next to us are constantly asking them to speed up. We spent most of the time just waiting. Absolutely not suitable for business lunch.
What I like:
- plenty of parking lots
- air conditioned
What can be improved:
- food taste need to be greatly improved
- serving frustratingly slow",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
Very friendly and nice food definitely recommend,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Service quality very good. The indian staff at the counter super friendly and good manners. The food is terrible. Super sweet, the fries were cold soggy. Terrible terrible terrible. New place so I guess standard not there. First and last time trying this place. Not suitable for vegetarian. Low quality food too. Shake was really thick but quality not there for the price paid.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Today is Deepavali, so not crowded at all. The mutton biriyani is very tasty and not all all spicy. The mutton melts perfectly in your mouth. The chicken corma and garlic naan is a great pair. I can tastes the richness in the corma.

Overall great food. Staff are friendly and welcoming.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Pretty good Indian food, not cheap but not too expensive. Good place for folks living in bayshore area, it's with the condo but open to public.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"A dinner treat from my cousin on 17 Feb. We had the $888++ dinner menu for 10pax.

1st dish: CNY Yusheng with Tiny Baby Abalones
Comments: Looks delicious but I didn’t eat it. My children enjoyed it.

2nd dish: Braised Shark’s Fin Soup
Comments: Tasted salty but flavourful.

3rd dish: Braised Vegetables with Baby Abalones
Comments: Nicest amongst all

4th dish: Roast chicken with crackers
Comments: Common and standard roast chicken

5th dish: Steamed Sea-bass with Garlic
Comments: Fish meat not that tender and the taste of garlic was over powering.

6th dish: Steamed Prawns with Garlic
Comments: Nice and generous portion

7th dish: Fried Ee-fu Noodles with Enoki Mushrooms and Bamboo Shoots
Comments: Wok Hey taste and texture good

8th dish: Creamy Mango Sago with Peach Gum
Comments: Looks unpleasant and not appetising due to its colour and it tasted too sweet.

Overall, I think their customer service was better than their dishes. 😁",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"One of the regular Zi char stalls that I patronise. Salted pork ribs is a must try!

$34nett meal cost:
- Salted Egg pork ribs $14
- Seafood Hor Fan (medium) $8
- Triple Egg Spinach $12

You can take bus 238 from Toa Payoh Mrt & alight at the 5th stop at blk 23. Yi jia is located at the blk infront. Walkable distance.

There's a toilet right next to the stall too.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The service was outstanding, the staff were very friendly, professional and immaculate. The highlight was the pizza, this was like it was made in Napoli and the ambience was just perfect. The dough and toppings were made from the finest ingredients, better than any pizza I have had in Australia and better than I have had in Lake Como. The carpaccio fish (sashimi) was delicate and delicious. The smaller steak size which we ordered wasn’t on the menu but we couldn’t eat such a large serve that was offered and they accommodated to our needs. The steak was seasoned perfectly and cooked medium rare also to perfection. I can’t speak more highly of this restaurant that is at Capella. We wanted to dine at a very nice restaurant this evening and even looked at what Michelin star restaurants were around, but this place an excellent choice and the wine we choose was a Pinot noir which complimented our dining experience.10/10 compliments to the chef Antonio.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Staff very nice to remaid the waiting time,
After 8PM need wait 20 minutes.
But the KFC apps very stupid, the apps price expensive then shop, also never remind food need wait and closing time.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
We love Blossom at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore! We came back the next day to try the dim sums during lunch and absolutely loved every single dish. The service is simply perfect; we kept getting our tea refilled throughout our meal…Thank you! We will be back when we visit Singapore.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Food is super good, flavour on point. Tandoori chicken was so fresh and tender. MASALA TEA MUST TRY!!!! 👍",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Very limited selection.
Overall it’s good enough to satisfy dim sum cravings.

Generally airport food/restaurants are bad.

No comments. Will I return. Likely not. Going to try other bad restaurants in the airport.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
"Ambience was great with a smaller crowd when we arrived 8pm+ on a Saturday. Staff were interactive and fun to converse with. Food was also great, and the mashed potatoes with the wagyu steak sealed the deal for me.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Takeaway big breakfast meal with corn options.
But no spoon, no butter for corn?
Inside big breakfast don't have hashbrown also.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"I rarely have a ""fancy"" lunch but on a friends recommendation (she also hasn't been), we decided to give it a try. Great first impressions upon entering the restaurant- very agreeable interior design and furnishings and a very warm welcome was extended. The menu was indeed interesting with 2, 3 and course options priced very reasonably at $45, $55 and $65. The selection was not extensive but very well curated with sufficient choices to whet one's appetite. There are surcharges for more premium selections but we found them very worthwhile and value for money. 4 of us ordered various combinations and every dish from starters to desserts were impressive from plating presentation to taste. In short  a great restaurant with a well curated menu, very well executed dishes (sauces for all mains and starters were uniquely different), great elegant ambience and certainly value for money. I would return to dine here for sure. The Chef definitely knows what he is doing and the service crew was great ..attentive, responsive and knowledgeable.  We need more restaurants of this calibre and price point. GREAT job guys !!!!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Food tastes authentic and service was quick. They noticed that we were not comfortable outside because of the smoke and offered to move us in with all our food.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"First time and loved the vibe. The food was generally good. In particular the sides. The scallops, prawn sushi roll and grilled octopus. The pork was a tad tough but the taste of the meats were good. Will come back again!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The only restaurant that I know; offers cold or warm water the moment you sit down. Instead of charging for water like the majority of restaurant.
Second reason, they hire special needs staff. Awesome!
3rd is affordability and serving good ice cream. Kudos Swensen's 😀",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Today we have visit blk 801 alsalam restaurant. We have order one Masala dosa and sambar (veg) . Halfway we saw he put inside the sambar mutton piece. I show them. But they haven't give answer. They have don't care.   I am vegetarian.  I have very bad experience with this restaurant. Next time I don't want to visit there. I request everybody be careful.,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Just don't order the food from them in panda. Food is totally cold when arrive and uneatable, have to throw away. Total waste of money.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Pizza hut Macpherson  is cooling  place, order a pizza waiting  time verry fast. Pizza served  was hot and fresh. Staff friendly. Will visit  again.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
It’s a laid-back neighborhood pub. Owner is a nice gentleman who is really friendly. Nice place for a quiet drink or two with a few friends.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Although Michelin 1 star title cannot be extraordinary because Singapore is one of the famous countries regarding gourmet, it is definitely sure that Labyrinth is so special because it only focuses on Singaporean cuisine.

Each menu including detailed explanation with distinctive story about Singapore culture and ingredients was impressive, and the best point is they succeeded in catching the taste.
(Lots of restaurants are missing)

I highly recommend this place if you want to experience something special available only in Singapore with low pressure to try unusual food.

This restaurant has a nice selection of pairings.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"We had dinner here during peak dinner hour on Saturday. Very crowded, we queued about 20-30 mins. The beehoon was good, the best among all other dishes we ordered, the fried rice was a little bit too spicy for my uncle; but it was ok for me. Rest of other dishes were decent and above average. We will love to come back to try out more food here.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Worth visiting, I was there about 5:30pm. No queue but the place already packed. The service was great, friendly & helpful! Food was delicious & portions are quite big. No for dates, as the seating is a bit squeeze to accommodate more diners. Wide variety of food available.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Nice, clean and comfortable.  Aircon.   Updated with the new menu here that I venture over to look for lormee but their zichar chef have left.  Everyday cooked menu is different, today is longtong and mee siam.  So I tried long tong. Clean taste. Not super salty gao type. I would say they are managing nicely. Crowd is ok.  A few regulars chatting and having tea and bread as breakfast.  The 2 ladies are nice and polite (for the people who are very crazy about services. ) Plates are served and collected by them. Next time i would try the bread for a change. The price are reasonable too.  Come here for a light meal or dish of the day. :)   Why 4 stars? The variety is limited but this place is clean and well maintained. It’s not some place that you want to seek fancy western dishes here.  The strange wu Xiang dishes have replaced the Kuehs (Chinese pastry).",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The drink stall lady is very lovely!
Went there a few times after work to get a drink and the lady selling the drinks is always smiling and makes your drinks really fast!
Has a variety of snacks as well!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Visited this restaurant a month back on a Sunday evening with a party of 4. I ordered 3 dishes  - steamed pork belly (梅菜扣肉), steamed sea bass, a vegetable plus soup . The vegetable and soup were great but when it came to the steamed pork belly, we were shocked to find out that the inside of the dish was frozen! Which means the dish wasn't prepared to order. They must have cooked it on another occasion, kept in the freezer, and steamed it again before serving. When we informed the server, she hurriedly told the lady boss who replied it's ok - we can steam it again?!? When the sea bass was served, we also noted that almost a third of the flesh on one side of the fish was missing. As I had a guest with me, I didn't want to kick up a fuss. There were obviously a lot of other repeat customers in the restaurant as they know the lady boss personally. So I can't understand why we had such a disappointing experience on our first visit.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
Bought mutton bryiani was shocked to see only just bone and tendon theres literally no meat. What kind of sick joke is this very poor,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Nice atmosphere, great lighting and set up. They served bread with olive oil. olive oil was served in a small dish that has a design of balsamic vinegar at the bottom, what a let down when I tried so hard to get the vinegar but it's not there!

Chicken paella - tasted better than it looks. Looks a little overdone and burnt. The staff squeezed the lemon for us with his bare hands, who knows if he had washed his hands before. And then he stirred the paella for us so vigorously some ingredients flew out onto the table.

Seafood tapas - portion was generous.

Omellete tapas - yummy.

Lastly, very rude manager who came over and told us to repeat our order of drinks (even when we said we JUST ordered from another service staff) -  he said ""oh he tends to forget so just tell me what you ordered"".
What kind of team spirit, culture and management is this when you are condescending towards your colleagues.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Restaurant closes at 9.30pm, we arrived at a 9.30pm, they entertained us,  did not turn us away,  no pressure to finish our food. We left around 10am.
Staffs were pleasant and attwntive.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"This is a hole in wall place that serves delicious Thai food.

It’s very clean. They have the air-conditioned section and the non air con area. Despite that, it’s very airy with lots of circulation due to the fans installed.

We always ordered Thai Steam fish and prawn cake. These two are a lovely combination.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Tasty food and the place is really crowded, recommend you to pre-book in advance and dishes that are signature. Food gets sold out really fast! Recommend the soup and you might want to skip the desserts.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"absolute disappointing staff service and dining experience.
my phone battery was left with less than 10% and i asked if i could charge my phone. (let's be honest in this century you can't do anything without a phone) the staff and manager told me charging phone for a customer is not allowed.

i replied ""how am i supposed to leave this place and book a grab without a phone? and i don't carry wallet, i use apple pay. with no phone i can't pay for your ramen here""

they then replied ""then u can pay now beforehand""

lol absolutely unbelievable, extremely appalled by their response. never coming back here again.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Had lunch here a few weeks ago on a Sunday. Ordered two prawns, fried rice, sweet and sour pork etc. They are very fast and flavorful. Surprise hidden gem in fact. And it’s not too pricey for the quality. Service prompt too. Will return again.

Went to east treasure again (7 months later) after they moved to Toa payoh - full house on a Sunday. Once again very very good food - tasty good quality food. Very good quality control. Service again very good.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"It has been awhile since i had pepper lunch. The food is really nice and smells great. The service is good and food is served to us once it is ready. There is no service charge. GST is already included in the price.

The price range is higher compared to their stalls at food courts. The restaurant is spacious and there is safe distance between customers.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Food was tasty, well balanced flavour, just about right amount of spice and numbing effect. Service was good and will come back again.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Looking for a place to hangout and not so crowded. Randomly chanced upon this on google map and there i went.
Serves a great variety of korean food, including sliced noodle, korean dumpling soup, chilli hotplate chicken with cheese.
An authentic rare find for a kpop style cafe filled with female kpop singer music.

I presume i can visit a few more times just to try all the good food.
The korean dumpling soup is delicious, with smooth and tasty dumplings, filled with meat and rice vermicelli.
The hotplate chilli chicken is lacking compared to chuncheon dakgalbi, but still tender and filling for us.
The 3x chilli tofu stew is my friend's personal favorite, but its too spicy for me. Definitely packed a punch.

The bad thing about this place is that the air-conditioning is bad, and we are sweating profusely with hot and spicy food.
Plus, the side dishes are lacking, only got 3 type although unlimited refill of kimchi.
But the service from the staff is not bad, prompt and friendly.
Good to try again.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Went on Sunday(17/4) evening.
Alot of dishes was sold out by 7pm..
For dim sum sold out by 7 pm its still understandable.

But no congee, no char shu, no roasted pork, no roasted chicken. This is bad.

Super shorthanded, very difficult to get servers attention.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Nice cosy restaurant that is suitable for parties too. Location is opposite the Bukit Batok Swimming complex. Food is good, portions are decent. Do make reservations before coming down. It's run by students from Shatec. We had a birthday cake and they took the effort to put the candles and the birthday signs for us. There was a robot server that also helped to sing the happy birthday song. We had the braised beef cheek, the pan seared salmon, the striploin steak, and it also has 2 free kids meal for every 2 paying adults who order from the set meals. It's basically a 3 course dinner. They have bread and soup of the day. I especially liked the sorbet which was very refreshing! I thought its very well worth it for the price point and a good way to support our local culinary institute students to gain more experience in their line of work. Great job!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"This is our 2nd time heading here. The food and service is fantastic. They staff take care of of your needs and recommends the daily specials and if you have any dietary restrictions. Because we were given excellent service and served fantabulous food, we are here again for the 2nd time. We were served by Ms. Eebii, again. And she greeted us ever so pleasantly and took care of us during each course we had. Will definitely be back again.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"exceptional great service I would say . special thanks to Kwai, Pauline , Chloe and I couldn’t remember the name of the lady who was serving us , sorry my bad 😥  She was the most brightest with her beautiful smile .

One of the best Nasi Rawon. The satay also nice. But satay start late afternoon.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
The gluten free restaurant is a gemstone find especially for people with gluten intolerance. The food/dessert was yummy and glutenfree bread tasted like normal bread which is a rare find. Thank you for providing such delicious food suits for people with dietary requirements.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Great dining experience for CNY reunion dinner! Dishes are hot and delicious, and value for money

Feedback: Instead of giving pineapple tarts in place of dessert, pls consider serving Chinese dessert next time",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Very regular so-so Korean food. Though it's located in a hawker center, but price a little higher than hawker price. Ordered their Pork belly BBQ set, the Lettuce, garlic which I presume eaten as raw wraps were put together with the Enoki mushrooms, wouldn't that be cross contamination? And the plate that were in used for the BBQ is concave to collect the oil, but there's no outlet to drain the oil so the oil will splatter everywhere.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE

"Was very very dissappointed as in their website lunch were a lot of different variety of foods but when we got there as you can see in the photos that was all that was worth eating for $171.60..(3 pax)
Drove all the way from tebans to eat rojak diy and sweets and fried rice,prawns and mussels,salmon.apart from that staff were great and friendly.Not that i wont reccomend it its just not really worth the money and their menu is on rotation.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
Our fish was raw. We explained this to the service staff but they did not care. I would not eat or drink here it is a health hazard.,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Spot on service with an even greater hit on their food. Small menu, but wow does it show quality. Kurobuta Ragu Tagliatelle was just done to perfection. Al dente tagliatelle with a rich egginess to it paired with their ragu boasting kurobuta pork which adds depth to the whole dish and the natural sweetness of the pork made everything perfect. Their tiramisu was also spot on, creme was smooth and not too light or heavy and the lady finger was just right, not too soggy.

Simply amazing that was.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"I tried Hokkaido Sushi a couple of nights ago, and I have to say that it was an enjoyable experience!

Though the buffet spread is not vast, it’s diverse enough to be quite satisfactory. Some notable dishes that I tried were the wagyu beef cubes, grilled salmon head, and torched miso garlic swordfish nigiri. The QR code ordering system is intuitive, and food comes out quickly after each order.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Nice family kopitiam setting. Non aircon but today's weather was so cold, hence it was a pleasant dining experience. Food was yummy. Pricing was on a average side, fish was expensive though and took a while to be served.  Service is reasonable. Overall, recommended!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Honestly I haven’t dined here in 3-4 years but I finally went back and it’s AMAZING! Expect fast service yet DELICIOUS food!
🥵🌶️
We really loved the extra spicy sambal fried rice and hotplate tofu. The chicken Tom yum soup was generous, but the taste is alright.

Also liked that it’s well ventilated and clean.

Overall, it’s a good place to be. Will be back again for sure",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"visited t1 yesterday and our biriyani gravy was spoilt.
my 3 kids were eating the spoilt curry as their meals came first.
I told the service crew about the spoilt gravy he just said ok and continued his job. super poor service.

over pricing. I will report to NEA today.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"As we walked around the building thinking about what to eat after learning that our initial plan of having Mookata buffet was smashed due to that the shop was closed for a short period of time, we decided on an alternative Mookata Buffet at Cheese Story.

Before the pandemic, diners can help themselves with the free flow of food items from the designated collection point. Diners have to fill up the form on their preferred order.

The server set up the Mookata stove with few big pieces of pork lard in the middle of the pot surrounded by a pool of stock and a small tray of cheese by the side.

Let's wait for the pot to get hot and the lard to be melted so as to oil the pot.

Besides having meat, we do order some vegetables, quail eggs and vermicelli items.

Here are some more of our orders with cheese tofu, fish cake, hotdog, dumplings, luncheon meat etc.

Do not worry about the shells if you are ordering the crayfish as the server on duty will help us to deshell.

One of the consolations is that the service includes deshell of the crayfish which we find quite comfortable. The staff on duty will do it on the spot in front of us with a pair of gloves.

Other than that, the free flow of oysters. The oysters are plump and they are generous with the servings.

Other than Oysters, abalone, prawns, and crayfish. We have ordered bamboo clams, scallops, Lala, sotong (Squid) and deshelled prawns that were marinated with garlic chilli.

Here's our second round of meat, They are marinated with black pepper and garlic.

Let's dig in! The chilli they provided is not too bad but I prefer to dip most of my food into the cheese tray.

The shredded cheese was left at the side tray of the Mookata pot to melt with Nachos cheese. For the price of $29.90 Nett for Buffet style of Mookata, I find it worthwhile with the unlimited flow of seafood. Drinks are unlimited too and the server will come with a trolley of drinks and assist to top up our cups.

For the quantity and money, I will say one can enjoy having Mookata at a budgeted price. If you don't mind spending more on quality style Mookata, there are better ones within Golden Mile Complex.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Food wise, the mutton curry was slightly underwhelming and on the tougher side and curry was a bit tangy than expected. All items are cheap but would suggest going to your local Hawker centre. They make a  lovely coin prata (crispy, fresh and a little doughy on the inside) but not worth the travel unless you are in the area. Service was quick today (Monday afternoon) and plenty seating available at the centre.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Very nice mookata restaurant!! Wondering why I didn’t discover it earlier, maybe I need to explore more! Dishes are offered at a reasonable price $2.20 for most meat dishes and well marinated. Absolute enjoyed it and will visit again!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Came here for lunch set, I liked everything from the courses. Was filled by the end of lunch. Great service by the team as well.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
The place seemed a little warm but the breakfast set was good. Would go there again  when possible.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Aunt seller is very friendly.  because of Ramadan They sell a lot of traditional snacks.  I bought some snacks that I couldn't find in other Malay stalls, “Getuk” which is made from cassava with sugar and coconut.  This stall has the best curry puffs.  But they don't sell sardines flavor today, which is the best I've ever eaten.  Usually they sell in the afternoon, and selling well.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
order the beef pepper rice and the taste is soooo good!!! they are very generous with their food portions and the service is really fast too!! really recommended to go there. The cheese naan with the butter chicken is SOOOO good too!!,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Great, tasty food for sharing at affordable prices, though it can get very crowded and queues can be long. Recommended to go during weekdays or non-peak dining hours to secure seats and have a less bustling environment.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"ordered take aways at bedok branch here. ordered their garlic fried chicken, stir fried vegetables. one of the best restaurants i have eaten in bedok. reasonable price too.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Came to dine on a weekend, so had to wait for table as it’s crowded. The food is nice and value for money. The beef is done to the medium I wanted, chicken chop also tastes good. And they have Stella beer on tap at a very good price. Will definitely come back again.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"We had:

Classic Chengdu Seabass in Sour Pickled Soup which was seasoned just nice for my taste - not overly sour with a hint of chilli.  I usually dislike seabass but this really changed my view.

Awesome Spicy Chilli Chicken (minus the Fried Dough Twist) which was aromatic with great spicy and numbing flavour.  The little bits of dried garlic in the dish was fragrant as well.

Sichuan Inspired Traditional Homemade Mapo Tofu was a little oily but it was surprisingly spicy.

Stir-fried Jack Beans with Red Chillis and Sichuan Pickles is usually a hit-or-miss dish. Most restaurants fail to remove the fibrous seams but here they have done really well. Each stalk was plump and full of flavour.

Osmanthus Fermented Wine with Rice Balls was a sweet ending to the savoury dinner.  It's good if you have a sweet tooth.

The only thing that wasn't ideal was the plain rice which was probably pre-scooped as the top layer had already dried and hardened.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Not bad, decent food. Tried their newer items. Felt the chicken prawn roll might have been a tad bland. But the other items were alright.

Service was good and professional",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Nice malaysian chinese food came here 4 times tried quite a few like laksa, Malaysia lor mee and some typical zhi char food like bean sauce chicken cube rice all nice heard the chef is from Malaysia so far no hit any food not nice taste as if went to malaysia to eat recommend",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

"Generous portions, good value for money and very friendly service. It is air conditioned too. We were staying at the Amara hotel in October 23 and this restaurant was nearby.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
I went here after lunchtime since it is the way to easily get empty seat. One of the very few halal Indian food around.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The oyster was tasty and juicy, with nice flavours and great taste. However, since we ordered this for takeaway and had it when it was a little bit cold, it may not have tasted as good as it should be if eaten immediately, we hope to try this again once dine in is available!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"East Coast Hawker is a culinary gem that I can’t recommend enough! The variety of dishes they offer is truly impressive. From the mouthwatering satay and succulent BBQ chicken wings to the flavorful fried Hokkien mee and fried oyster, every bite is a delightful experience.

One standout dish for me was the Sambal sting ray fish, a unique and delicious option that’s a must-try. And don’t forget to quench your thirst with their refreshing sugarcane drinks.

The ambiance is great for casual dining, and the staff are always welcoming and attentive. Whether you’re a local or just passing through, East Coast Hawker is a culinary adventure you won’t want to miss. It’s a place where taste buds are tantalized, and I can’t wait to return for more.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Super delicious food, super friendly and accommodating 老板娘 who cut the noodles + chicken slices (pho) so thinly so my bro could eat w his new braces on! Love it",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

"I read that this place was opened by a local celebrity and has been around a few years, so decided to bring my friends for lunch to check it out.
The dishes were creative and tasty. We loved the raw oyster with a kimchi based sauce and the melt in your mouth Jamon with sweet cherry tomatoes. The cocktails were not very fancy but it was creatively mixed and tasted well.
It is located in a business area so is a good place to entertain business clients or partners or a nice wind me down meal with colleagues after work.
Service was good.
Toilet is clean.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"I loved their curry and Masala Tea, which is quite similar to Ginger tea, but less spicy and more fragrant. Overall price bit on the high side, i guess cant be helped as the location (considered tourist area). Also they kinda shorthanded with 1 pax manning the cashier at early morning (5am ish) and also the server, but carried out order pretty effectively.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"This is the 2nd time to this restaurant, we had different dishes since the menu is flexible. Thumbs up for the cold crab and drunken crab which we had sake to go with it. The other highlight was the beef ball which was told by chef it was freshly made, I also packed some home and would say it is a must try. Overall, the experience was very good with a fair bill.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Sol & Ora has a lovely dining area and when you go around the 3pm-4pm time slot, the lighting and view is fantastic for food shots and photos! The waitstaff was friendly and kind to us as we were dining and their afternoon tea is delicious and had just the right portions without having you feel too full. Highly recommended and will be back again!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Nice, calm and clean restaurant! Good seating arrangement, polite staffs. Poori masala that I ordered was really good. Masala tasted nice and meal was value for money. Neatly packed.
Near to bus stop: Before Geylang Bahru Station (Stop ID: 60031)",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"My to-go restaurant after 10:00PM for supper. Offers a variety of food ranging from Chinese, Indian, Malay, Western and local delights. Some of my favourites include but not limited to their Mutton and Chicken Briyani, Roti Prata, Hainanese Chicken Rice, Seafood Hor Fun, Penang Char Kway Teow, Tom Yam Seafood Soup, Sambal Kangkong and Black Pepper Crab. Friendly staff too. It can be difficult to get their attention if they’re packed with customers and food delivery orders. My advice is to just walk up to any of them and place your order to avoid unnecessary delays. Will continue to visit. ;)",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
The dim sums here are flash and taste very good. The Shao Bao was the best. Should try it.,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
"Sol & Ora

Located on a quiet level of The Outpost Hotel Sentosa, Sol & Ora is a Mediterranean cuisine restaurant with a Latin vibe.

What caught my attention were the Greek dishes on the menu. The only thing that came to my mind was Ouzo,  a dry anise-flavored aperitif that is widely consumed in Greece.

However, other than some of the Greek wines, I see no Ouzo. I tried my luck and asked the restaurant manager, who is a Russian-Greek, to offer me his private stash of Ouzo.

He explained that as there is only a small committee of Greeks in Singapore, not many restaurants or people will know such a spirit. Well, I'm sure glad that I asked.

Spirits aside, food and service were great. The restaurant manager was jovial and able to recommend wine pairing dishes.

The octopus dish is a must-order dish. The parma hams blended so well with the unsalted octopus and well grilled potatoes.

Food: 🍻 🍻
Service: 🍻 🍺 (Though service was good, dining experience somehow affected by the loud conversations going on in the open kitchen by the kitchen staff)
Price: 🍻 🍻 (For the food quality and service, I'm willing to pay)
Will go again: 🍻 🍻 🍺",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Loved the sambal stingray and the BBQ prawn. Had the order as take away so the family can dine at the sea side area. The lady is so thoughtful and ensure that all the utensils and the needful are properly assorted for us. We had a fabulous sunset meal at the seaside.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"quality of the food was okay. ambience and outdoor sitting area is lovely. service staff were doing their best but severely short staffed.

portions are a bit small each average cost of each stick $3-4, one prawn would cost ~$8 so a bit on the pricey side. despite being the earlier customer, we waited ~35 min before food is served and it came plate by plate with more waiting in between. udon portion small. many customers around us also waiting and even finished their drinks alr. overall, waited 4/5 of the time and honestly not worth the wait :-( got potential but would not come back cos of long wait :-( and so so food",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Good customer service, but i ordered indian full grilled chicken  its not same in indian style totally different. They add after the owen some masalas and red chilli, the masala raw smell. I want tamilnadu restaurants style crispy and dry and fully cookied  grilled chicken from owen.  Please take note.. Next time give me..
Thank you so much",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"We had the Omakase set for 108 sgd per person -indeed very interesting,we loved especially the scallops ;too pricey though",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
We have 8 pax we ordered medium 三味虾球. They got no more prawns and change to small size. They didn't even check with us is it OK for us and just tell us they change the bill to small don't worry but very expensive 7 small prawns for $20 and we have 8 person not even enough for 1 each. Terrible!!,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"it deserve a 2-star, it is worth a detour.

Forgive me if i cant praise this restaurant higher and better.

Their service is excellent, they respect every guests, serve politely and most important, they are able to present their food with confidence, which I don’t often see that in many Michelin 1-star restaurants.

Their theme is onion, every bit of this restaurant cohere with this theme and very well executed. Every dish has its own stunning way to impress diner, each has its little back story and each is presented in an surprising manner. I appreciated the bomba rice the most as it shows the bravery and innovation the chef has with the food, even it is just rice. Not sure if they call themself molecular gastronomy, but last time I had such innovative experience was in Bo innovation.

And as equally important, I think they are quite generous in using luxury ingredients, like a ping pong size caviar is just pure indulgent.

I don’t have much Michelin 2star dining experience but among other 1 star restaurants I had in the past, this one is simply the best and deserve differentiation from the rest.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Overall the experience is good. Visited many times and food quality is constantly good.

We ordered two kind of Unagi but both looks the same. Recommend to try it as its presentation and quality is good. They also have option for Free flow of Yuzu drink @ 6.50 but we had a glass @ 4.50 as my wife wish to try abit. Free flow drinks unable to share or try more than 1pax.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Vegetarian very nice,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"First time trying The Nosh burger. It has delicious crispy pork patty coupled with spam and egg. Although normally I choose to get their burger with beef patty, this pork patty also doesn't miss.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The place is not crowded. The food was simple, less oily but tasty. Their iced Teh C hit the spot.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The food taste ok but not as good before. Service by Jasmine was very good. She was very attentive, warm and friendly.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Food cmi.. chicken was extremely hard and dry. Tomato soup was WATERY. Steak was ok though standard. The attractive thing for this outlet is the view and the atmosphere. Hope they do better.,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Had a wonder friends get together session at Summer Yakitori! Cozy chill area suitable for friends to gather and enjoy a night.

Would like to thank the boss and lady boss whom showed great hospitality, making our evening a very pleasant one.

Food served were of quality and taste in proportion to yakitori standards.

Glad to have found a place where friends can gather, have some beers with yakitori! Will definitely gather there again.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The meal has always been good. However the experience with only 1 specific staff has not been great and it is not a one time experience. His attitude was fairly bad and saw that he shakes his head at customers for no apparent reason either right after they leave or from far. This happened on the 2 seperate occasions I have visited. With those 2 times, only saw him interact nicely to a family that ordered wine. But I was sure both times I did not spend below 110.

Unpleasant with just that 1 staff member causing me to not be visiting again.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Honestly a gem!! The Chili pomelo crab was excellent..! Really loved the pomelo , nice touch to the usual Chili crab but did not detract from the taste.

Crab fried rice was also a big hit and while I’m not a pork eater, the rest of the crew loved the coffee ribs

Great service and vibe !",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

"Really love the decor and ambiance!

Food and drinks is very large portion at a rather reasonable price! Almost 900ml? For $4.50

Breakfast is only 12.90 that is a plate full of food!

The replica of mamashop is 1-1 💯 you can even purchase the little snacks and toys from them! How nostalgic!

Love it!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

"Nice to be able to take my dog to an indoor restaurant that serves Korean cuisine, as most of the pet friendly places serves western cuisine. Food is nice esp the black bean noodles👍and pancake.  Most impt, they have Pet menu. 3 items to choose. The staff passed us a pet diapers for our dog😁.  My dog sat on the chair with us.  The staff are friendly and attentive.  Will definitely ho back again.
Found out there is another outlet, Jeuk Seok Town in Changi that serves BBQ and hotpot😋  and looking forward to visit that too.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Damn good food here,staff very friendly and cool,helpful too!highly recommend this place.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"On my visit this time around, I spent around $80 for 2 pax which is quite pricey in my opinion, but we managed to sample a variety of dishes. My craving for Japanese cuisine led me back to this familiar location, as I've had decent experiences with this sushi chain in the past. This time, however, my dining experience was satisfactory but not exceptional. The food was decent, and the service was average, although one staff member appeared visibly discontent.

As usual I'd order their salmon belly sashimi which is acceptable, 3/5, and their salmon sashimi which was disappointing,1/5. Both the sashimi dishes were not fresh at all, and they were poorly sliced. The only difference was that the salmon belly sashimi came in thicker slices compared to the regular salmon sashimi.

Their Chuka Idako, seasoned baby octpopus, were a little too big for my liking. The takoyaki was also quite poorly made. They were a little overcooked on the outside, tasted dry on the inside, and they did not give it enough toppings. Their fried squid tentacles were also a little too salty in my opinion. I also ordered their scallop sushi which was quite tasteless and not worth the price. I tried their promotional dish, the snow crab leg sushi, and it was also not worth it. The crab leg was too tiny. Another promotional dish I tried was the crab chawanmushi and it was the best dish out for all.

Overall, my dining experience here so far has been alright. For the quality, I'd say this place is a little overpriced. While dining here is acceptable, don't expect top quality food or service.

Edit 24/12/23:
I ordered food delivery from here via Grabfood. I had their salmon sashimi, salmon belly sashimi and hotate sashimi. Surprisingly this time round the Sashimi was better compared to when I dined in. The quality was better, it tasted fresher and the cuts were better sliced. I also ordered some variety of sushi and all were decent. What surprised me the most was the delivery time. It was delivered 10mins faster than Grab's prediction despite me ordering slightly past lunch time.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Wanted to share a meal with my partner and he recommended us to go for the $12 option. Another friend ordered a $6 option when the food came and both portion were exactly the same. I asked him why he immediately turn and walked off. Not recommended.,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Beers are overpriced at $15-20, and not much of a view (facing the street). Seating is fairly limited",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"I had my Coin prata with mutton. Coin prata was slightly on the sweeter side. Otherwise, food was not too bad. Seats were available during lunch time compared to the 2 hawker centres near by. That's why I dropped by :p",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"This is the first time i encounter a restaurant that refuse early guest when they are not even half filled. We had a reservation at 7pm, however we made ourselves arrive earlier because we both were excited about our date. Never did we expect that hotel of such calibre would refuse to seat their guest until 15 mins before reservation time. How inflexible.

The food is nothing fantastic. Label of food is wrong placed, some with no label. Chicken rice too oily, satay cooked on hotplate is not acceptable hotel restaurant standard. Maybe the foreigners can accept this. only 4 types of cheap seafood on ice. How pathetic. the Cha soba was over cooked and still placed out for guest. the noodles was mushy and sauce was super diluted. Did the chef even try what was placed out?

Never will i recommend anyone here or return for another visit. Horrible experience.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Spacious place
Good for dine in
Take away
South Indian-veg non veg
Parata
Beer also available-tiger and Indian beers
Good place for company dinner (South Indian)",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Collagen soup is recommended. The taste is rich and essence of chicken is well-infused into the broth. Vegetables are fresh and sweet. I feel that for $19, the collagen soup can do better with at least some ingredients in it. Condiments, the leek oil is flavourful. Nanbe chicken could do better with better frying of the batter. The dish tasted a little under fried and batter was soft.

Staff used to be and could be more attentive. The broth was boiling away and they only adjusted the induction cooker upon request, twice. No one came to skim the floating fats off the soup or offer a sampling of it, which they used to do so. Also, there wasn’t any personal touch to make you feel welcome whatsoever. It was a you say I do approach.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Cannot meaningfully recommend this. Below average experience. We ordered 3 Med rare ribeyes; one was burnt and sent back, the other was underdone (very rare) but we didn’t want to send back yet another steak. We ordered 2 lamb chops and sent back 1 for being burnt on the outside. Seafood platter (at 288) was poor; sauce was very one dimensional.

Service excellent and flatbread appetiser was good. Excellent service is the reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1.

This restaurant seems to cater to the patrons of rws instead of being a destination in itself. There are many better steakhouses at a similar price point in SG. The table behind us also complained about the seafood platter. That said, we were told the main chef was on leave the day we dined so perhaps our poor food was a one-off. However, at this price point, much more is expected.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Went there on a Friday for lunch with my family when I was on leave.  The restaurant is not crowded and we had all the attention from the waiter when we wanted to order the food.  The food also came promptly since there are only a few diners.  We ordered 3 freshly shucked oysters and 3 wasabi tartar oysters.  The oysters are fresh and thick and not surprisingly we  ordered more!  We went straight to the main course without any desserts.   We ordered Foie Gras Jewel Truffle Gyu, Charcoal-Grilled Char Siew Unagi and Spicy Mentaiko Don.  I must say the servings are not that big for big eaters but are sufficient for us as the ingredients are  overflowing the bowls.  Again, the ingredients used are fresh and that’s very important especially for Japanese restaurants.  We really enjoyed them very much and finished them in no time.  With good service and fresh ingredients, I would rate them 4-stars.   Price wise, they are not the cheapest but also not the most expensive Japanese Restaurants out there.   Would I go back again, yes.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

"Very short distance from MRT station. The chicken wing is very good; juicy and flavorful with spice/seasoning. The Prosciutto Di Parma pizza is great as well with the parma ham taking the star of the meal. The Carne pizza was good but still fall behind the Prosciutto Di Parma pizza. The tiramisu was okay, slightly dry and sweet. Overall great dining experience, will dine again in the future.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

"Prawn cakes were so small, totally different from photos, expensive. Claypot chicken was very salty too. Signature beehoon was so so. Overall very disappointing.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Decent German fare, shambolic service.
Ordered a pretzel, Salmon rosti and water. Both dishes tasted decent and were served quickly.
Unfortunately, water wasn't served till it was time for payment. By then had I finished my meal. There wasn't a word of apology or a hint of remorse for this regrettable service hiccup.  Say less about needing to pay an additional dollar for the glass of ""refillable"" water that I eventually left without having a sip of.
I  requested to be seated away from the smoking area and was met with a rude response from the server. The lack of proactiveness to help move my plates over sums up the disaster-class from the restaurant,  leaving me to move the plates by myself.

An upsetting experience that I will actively avoid in future.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"01 Dec 2023: Great meal...masala chicken, cauliflower, black squid, fish cutlet and the amazing fish head curry which is not too spicy. Seated in the air-conditioned room is just too noisy for us. We will return for more and will request for outdoor seating.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Had probably the worst fried rice I’ve ever eaten in my life and it was $16.80. Dry and bland like they forgot that oil and salt exists. It’s seafood fried rice but there were just tiny dry shrimp, crabmeat tiny balls and the driest fish chunks . I know it’s a tourist area but for this price this food is not even a tenth as good as any random zichar shop in Singapore. It’s a shame to serve this fried rice in sg.

Xiaolongbao was mediocre at best and also $16.80 for 6. Stingray was not quite fresh but edible thanks to the sambal we were able to ingest that horrid fried rice. Oh also the vanilla milkshake was $13.80?? The only decent thing was that the $8.80 apple juice was at the very least freshly juiced

Eat here if you want to spend an unreal amount of money on bad food.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
3 stars for flavor but 5 stars for serving size = 4 🌟 . That was our Pad Thai and Basil pork. Tom yum soup was as good as anything I've had but seems a tad pricey. Service was prompt. No complaints there. Likewise for ambience. Will return for my Thai food fix as there is no doubt they do serve authentic Thai.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

"It was a last minute search nearing 2 pm on a weekday for a lunch place after a very active outing with our 2 young ones.  My partner searched this place and I called to check if they are opened in the afternoon.  Many restaurants/cafes have their kitchen closed from 2 pm to 6 pm so you can never be too careful.  The man answering the phone was very polite and friendly and I made reservations for a table on the spot.

A very Pet friendly restaurant.  Many patrons brought their pooches with them - Air-conditioned indoors.  If you are allergic to doggie fur, this might not be ideal.

I like the decor and feel of the place.

The menu has a slightly limited variety.  Food quality is good.  Kids meal portion is generous - 2 can share!

Good place to come back to try the rest of the menu although car park could be a challenge for weekends",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Food standard has dropped by so much, my family and I came down here quite frequently. Especially during special events such as birthdays and we always order their seafood, sambal sotong, sweet and sour seabass and stringray and we used to enjoy it so much. However, today when we came down all the food was disappointing, the stingray look so different, it was wet and very watery not the usual sambal bbq stringray that we ate where the sambal is slightly drier and the sambal look more darker. Their sambal sotong also came in looking very different the sambal was so watery that it looked no different from the sweet and sour sauce. Also, some of their cockles tasted bad like they were spoilt. Approached the staff to give our feedback not to demand any refund or replacement of food, but it seems like they were lazy to entertain and just said it was the same. However, looking back at all the past review and seeing the sambal stingray and now there is clearly a difference. So disappointed and never dining in here again.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Used to order from here fairly often before the rebranding. Since the name changed the food standard has dropped. The curry was disgustingly oily and the container was split so it spilled everywhere

"Excellent food and awesome service! Food took quite awhile to come but as they say good things come to those who wait. We ordered both the pizza special (white sauce pizza with ham, mushrooms n some cheese) and pasta special (lobster pasta). I love that the pizza wasn’t salty… Lobster pasta had so much depth of flavor, rest was also very generous with the lobster meat! Our bellies were very satisfied by the end of the meal. Awesome place!!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

"Food was really great here service was amazing. My utensils was changed after every meal.
The atmosphere of the restaurant was very homely, just like those I visited in Italy.
They took note that it was my partners birthday and surprised her. Very lovely staff!
Ordered the 6 course meal at $126/pax, was pleasantly surprised by the no menu food served. Price was a little steep but worth it. Will come again to order other dishes. 😃",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The winning dish is the suan cai broth! Spicy level is definitely there, and the sourness matches it well. Occasionally you chee on that peppercorn and the numbness kicks in. Other superior broths are light in nature but it goes very well with the fish paste. Golden pillows are well done and do use it to soak up the broth for a better unami bite. They offer rice balls for desserts in either soy milk or ginger tea. Menu is slightly confusing though, takes awhile to understood the ‘add-on’.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"We really miss Vietnam so we came for Bahn Mi here but they dont have it. Only available at Bedok Outlet. Pho was ok. Taste wise quite close to the Pho we had in Vietnam. But can be better. The fried rice was really yummy, good for children. A little quiet on a Saturday night dinner. They have that familiar Vietnamese vibes. There is a public carpark opposite the building, next to a condominuim. During peak period, carpark was full we had to wait for a while. Hope this helps.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Mains were uninspiring — tasted like elevated hawker food with better ingredients.

Starters, on the other hand, were more interesting and reflect better on the Korean-southern Indian fusion.

Spent about $100/person with 1 drink each (compulsory), which was quite expensive for what we ordered.

We were sat across the grill and could feel the heat. Would try to request for a seat away from the kitchen",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Need a car 🚗 to come to this place.
Was here on Monday evening & was surprised a band performing that night.
Beautiful sunset 🌅 & sea breeze to chill with drinks 🍺 & food
Staffs are responsive & with a smile whenever you need their attention",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Love the curry & nonya fish head. The prawn paste chicken is nice too. On average I pack about 6-8 dishes for takeaway. Just googled & found this Zh Char - tried once & love it - so far this is my 3rd takeaway within 2 weeks. Yet to try their crabs - will feedback once I tried.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
The food is nice and fresh. The yakimono and grilled food is highly recommended. The service is good as well. Will definitely come back again!,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"It was my first time at Restaurant Gaig, and I would say the food here is simply amazing!

Restaurant Gaig’s menu showcases Catalan dishes with traditional recipes dating back to the 19th century through Chef Marti’s innovative interpretations. They also have a really good selection of wines that you can consider going with the meal.

Highlight from the new Chef’s Menu ($180++ per diner) focus on the no wastage nose-to-tail Gastronomy – Lamb

Location: Restaurant Gaig,  16 Stanley Street Singapore 068735",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The bistro is large and spacious, offering a diverse range of food options from an extensive menu. The prices are reasonable considering the portion size, and the food itself is remarkably delicious. It's certainly a hidden gem in the area, and I would definitely choose to dine here again if I find myself in the vicinity.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Ordered Prawn Biryani and I was served rice with Prawn curry instead. The egg Biryani was served with rice and egg curry too.
Butter chicken seemed more like Chicken tikka curry.

All disasters in the name of taste and authenticity.

I hope the restaurant hires a good chef, who understands the true recipe combining it with right flavors and taste.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Had dinner there and the staff attitude (not all) are very lousy. One of the PRC lady seems very impatient and annoyed when I ask her questions nicely. Every time I ask her something I feel like I own her something that kind of feeling. When ask about the exact ingredients of the item cos it was written chicken but she keep saying it was Pork... she end up cannot confirm what she is saying.
Also end up one of the dish was the wrong item and we have to wait for very long while other dishes were finished. It wasn't a busy day for the restaurant but overall the service is just way below standard",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Came here for birthday celebration.
Nice atmosphere and thank you the Chinese lady Manager who always fulfils and cater our needs !
Definitely a worth place to visit 🎉",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Service staffs are friendly. Good food and nice ambience, next to the turf club. The only downside is waited too long for the salmon to be served. The beef cubes are surprisingly yummy 😋",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"This is the restaurant that purportedly invented the world famous black pepper crab  of Singapore.

We had our CNY gathering here and therefore there was the quintessential Loh Hei dish. The rest was part of the set menu including crispy roast duck and black pepper crab. And here they provide an extra bowl of the black pepper sauce just in case you can’t get enough of it.

Restaurant has al fresco dining and indoor including a second level with air conditioning.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Such an amazing experience! This was one of my favorite nights in Singapore. The bar area is beautiful and all of the staff are so nice. We tried a few drinks and they were all great. We didn’t have any food, but the food we saw others order looked nice. There’s great views of the city on both sides. Make sure to make a reservation if you’re wanting to book a table that’s outside!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Service are top notch and their food are above average!

Downside is that theres lots of chef recommendations food oos.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Chanced upon this eatery at Square 2 while looking for a lunch place. Decided to try though I am not a spicy food lover and not a fan of curry as well.
We ordered 2 sets of Tonkatsu sets that come with salad and a drink. Food took a while to come but from the first taste of the curry (Level 1 spiciness) I was hooked! The curry was perfectly cooked and the spice level just right. The pork was freshly fried and totally worth the value.
Don't understand how those lousy reviews come from also 🙄
Give it a try if you are at the area. Payment is by a kiosk just outside the entrance and accept all cards and Nets.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Booked table for 2 for our wedding anniversary and totally enjoy ourselves!

Tucked in a nice cosy east coast road with ez parking just steps away from this restaurant.

Waiting staffs were fantastic attending to our needs and helped us took photos! (As attached) .

Steaks were well recommended by friendly manager and it was well cooked by chef.  Complete with in house wine it's the perfect Lovely evening.

Highly recommended!

"Frequent patron for saffrons as I live nearby..
food standards hasn’t dropped, long time staff service is also good
I only have an issue with the new cashier; some uncle wearing specs..always wear grey. either he can’t hear properly when taking order or he cannot understand difficult order request like spicy and all. He needs training lol cuz he keeps asking me to slow down when my order is already relayed to him slowly and clearly 🤦🏻‍♀️",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Enjoyed a snack (Jewel Hiro Chicken) and happy hour drink (Lager Young Master) before getting down to a dinner of sandwiches (snow crab & fried fish) and truffle fries. Due to the circular design of the outlet, it was a tiny bit difficult to catch the staff if they weren't deliberately walking more than halfway around as my table was at the back of the space. However, every staff that I encountered was friendly, polite and professional. The food was yummy and surprisingly filling despite the fact that the portions didn't look very big. Would recommend a visit if you're at the airport. Oh the Yuzu Sake Spritz tasted like a non-alcoholic citrus drink. Dangerously yummy!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Briyani rice is a little spicy. Mutton is tough, don't try if you got weak tooth, there are no dentists around here. Try the chicken install.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE

"Brought my friend there to makan for her bday! The dinner set is worth the price. i ordered the crab pasta taste was soso, the calamari was quite blend. Dessert was better than the main courses. Ambiance was okay.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Came this evening (15/02/24) for a valentine date. Very disappointed in the food and service here. Initially saw it on TikTok when some influencer promoted it, it looked good there. Now I understand, maybe it was a paid promotion.

First of all, the atmosphere is not the best. Tables were placed very close to one another. When you walk in, it just doesn’t feel like you’re walking into a hotel standard buffet.

Then the service, the man at the sashimi bar was rude. When we ask for the sashimi, we are greeted with “what you want?!” In a very rude manner and they way he communicates with the customers is not nice. However, the staffs were fast to clear our used plates on the table and were borderline friendly.

Last, the food. The sushi doesn’t taste very fresh and of good quality. Same can be said for their snow crab legs, it wasn’t as fresh. The meat was rather dry and tasteless. I did not eat any of the raw food as I’m allergic, therefore no comments on the sashimi, mussels.

The cooked food was below average. It includes the self serve rojak station, roast pork, roast chicken, ghor hiang, herbal duck, stir fry pork and grilled chicken.

The acceptable cook food that was pretty good was their fried bee Hoon & chicken satay. Those were pretty yummy.

The WORST dish there was the Chilli crab. Now I don’t expect Tzar Char standard but it wasn’t even close. The crabs were extremely small, the meat was so dark in colour and it breaks apart so easily. It felt like the crab was stored for a long time. It taste very very bad. The sauce was okay with the mantou.

Overall, I would not pay 98++ (dinner) for a buffet of this standard. Won’t be revisiting.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Briyani was fragrant and not oily
7.90$ for chicken briyani and teh halia. clean and hygienic place
Greeted by random cat on my way out. Charming.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Food is nice and i have visited a few times after the reno. Hygiene needs to be improved - i had to swat a fly away from my food. Tables are not cleaned and left to customers to clean on their own.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Ordered mutton bryani.
Food was cold! Top part was hot bottom part was cold!

Whole restaurant only 3-5 people when i vist at around 4.35pm on 1jan2024.

The first thing the service staff tell me is no more food. Only left mutton bryani which is the food i wanted to eat.
He doesnt seem to be interested as i was not done with my order. I had to call him before he left after serving another family to follow up on my order.
And prior to my order he didnt even bother to give us a menu and insisted only left bryani and we had to ask for drinks menu to catch some of the drinks that are supposedly still available.

Food had 1 small hair on my yogurt! Can see in photo! Very hard to spot.

My wife had advised me not to visit as the review is bad and as a fan of indian food i couldn’t help myself but go against her advise.

Atmosphere at the cashier have a strong stench smell. The cashier girl only pass us the bank receipt at first, we had to ask for the food receipt then she give us.

How can a restaurant in Jewel be so ^%*]¥}¥^<! Up?
Can imagine the motivation i had immediately after the meal to send in this review, because to spread awareness so naive patrons be warned and have no regrets 🙏",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE

"Samy’s Curry in Dempsey stands apart with a distinctive ambiance, diverging from the sophisticated, fine-dining feel of its neighboring restaurants. Instead, it embraces a canteen-like atmosphere adorned with an 80s colonial setting, offering a nostalgic journey through time.

As a family-owned establishment, the culinary highlights include the fish head curry, squid, and fish bergedil (fried fish and potato cutlet). Served in a generous pot, the fish head curry captivates with its spicy, tangy profile, enriched with curry powder, tomatoes, tamarind, and a subtle sweetness. The marinated squid delights with its moist tenderness, while the fish bergedil boasts a pleasing texture and aromatic appeal. Unfortunately, there weren’t many vegetarian options to choose from.

Samy’s Curry Indian Restaurant in Dempsey offers an unassuming haven for delectable and reasonably priced meals. Despite its popularity among tourists, it remains a go-to destination for an authentic banana leaf meal in Singapore, preserving its status as one of the city's best.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Had an amazing dinner here. The food tasted authentic Thai, huge servings, service is prompt and welcoming and most of all the ambience is just wow. We dined at around sunset and we are just facing opposite the yacht! The cost is reasonable as well and we were very surprised considering the location. Highly recommend this place! You won't regret 😉",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

"Authentic Korean food and hospitality. The service staff gave great recommendations of food and drinks, and were extremely attentive to all our needs. Whenever we've to adjust the heat of the hot pot, start on the next course of sumptuous fried rice, or more drinks! They were right there when you need them. It's such a surprisingly great experience!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Food here was AMAZING! Every dish that was recommended to us was so delightful to taste. Highly recommend the mushroom ravioli for starters, the crab pasta, and the pizza (crust was so nicely done) ⭐️⭐️⭐️

Service was great too, they provided 4 wraps for our fajitas instead of the usual 3 as we came as a family of 4. He also shared these amazing recommendations, thank you very much! 🙏🏼☺️ will be back!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Delicious sze-char dishes. Must get the sambal pomfret. Any dishes that come with their sambal concoction is best friend with bowls of rice. The homestyle tofu was smooth and full of umami with those crispy mushrooms. The green vegs with fish floss was great as well. Service was quick and efficient, dishes came out quick and fresh.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"I takeaway four prices of prata kosong at $1.30 each. The size of the prata is probably the largest I have ever eaten!

I was given two large packets of gravy. One is fish curry, the other was Dahl.

The fish curry was sour and a little too salty.

The Dahl was thick and not watery. This is the first time I ever like Dahl curry!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Service needs alot of improvement as short-staffed (staff also insist to clear dishes really fast so we felt pressurized) but food is still good nonetheless!

Pasta and pizza dishes were both great and on par with other branches.

Cashier also require further training as I was paying using a standard chartered credit card to redeem the promo on my mobile but staff asked me twice if I confirm it to be a standard chartered credit card as it does not tie with the list that they were given. Standard Chartered changed the appearance and repackaged the unlimited card so….",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Food was average, service was average, atmosphere was average. All in all very average. But the food did arrive quickly, was fresh and fair quality ingredients. The nice part was it was overcast/drizzling the day we went so the kids enjoyed playing in the park outside. The chocolate banana shake was yummy!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"We love Tze Char places, had to queue 40 mins after we arrived around 530pm (Sat)
Been here once at their previous location further up the road. As usual, we ordered dishes we love, hor fun, chilli kangkong, bitter gourd w/sliced fish, Ngoh Hiang, yong tau foo, beef w/spring onions, roasted chicken + one big bottle Heineken
Voila only $150, for 5 of us, can’t be happier. Highly recommended for those who love tze char dishes anywhere anytime",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Their food was as authentic as you could get in China. The crowd was also mostly Chinese nationals so again it says a lot about authenticity of this place.

Dishes were served in speedy fashion, the chefs were utterly brutal in their execution; dishing out item after items in record time. Please make a reservation prior to heading over. I overheard from the staff speaking to a walk-in customer that there’s 8 more names in the waiting list.

Have to drop one star because of the sanitary conditions of the place. As it’s a really small establishment, everything seems very cramped and a few times I have to walk like a crab just to get back to my table.

Floor was sticky at most areas and towards the back of the shop it was wet with grey most stains all over. Imagine a wet market walkway. You’ll get the drift.

Probably the best way to enjoy this will be to order take out and eat in the comfort of your home if you’re picky with cleanliness.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"This place opens up at 11.30am, earlier than other lunch spots in the area. We decided on a mexican fiesta and as such, popped in for a quick fix and to our delightful surprise, we were not at all disappointed.

My dish was about $19 before GST. It was fried chicken with loads of tomato sauce on it, with cilantro rice and nachos on the side. My friends had nachos and enchiladas. The flavours were good and the cilantro rice was so yummy. They didn’t skimp on the cilantro and the rice was cooked to perfection, every rice with that intense cilantro flavour. My chicken was fried to perfection, and it was juicy and moist. The serving size is generous for what you’re paying.

The restaurant service was attentive, and I loved that they provided free iced water to patrons. Such should be the standard of more restaurants in Singapore.

The decor was quaint and cute.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Most important aspect,  place is clean and friendly service.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Great place. The staff is great! Thank you Muslim for your concern,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Had the Poori set , Masala Thosai and 2 drinks. Total price was $8.70, very reasonable. Portion was big and taste was good. The drinks were not sweet, just right. Only issue was the air conditioning was not turned on, so it was super hot and humid, almost like being in a greenhouse. Im sure during peak hours they would turn it on, i guess they were just saying money.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Highly recommended! Yup ! My kind of place! Call me fussy ! Had amazing Duck, fish & chips: Fish was moist & fleshy, chicken wings, endive salad a fav, charred broccolini , gambas & risotto all extremely good too. Oh forgot the dessert was super good too. Can’t rave enough about the food since i am fussy! Haha. Love the ambience away from the mad crowds ! Sharon biz development person & Chef explained what goes on behind the scenes to make it so yummy and happening. There’s an elegant private karaoke room too ! Was a Wonderful experience. Will definitely be back ! We had about 15 of us including kids for Sunday brunch/lunch ! Was not disappointed. Oh There’s an impressive wine cellar too ! Keep it consistent and attention to details matter ! Will bring me back with friends !",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Food was excellent and tasty. Although many years ago at the Havelock branch the food have more variety and taste better. I think that it is because of the ""pay as you like concept"", most people do not pay a lot. That is why the number of dish are lesser now and more cost effective dish are served. This makes sense because rental and staff are not cheap for them too. I read through the review and there are some complain about customer service. Personally I do feel it and get what they mean. I don't feel very comfortable eating there, this is the first time I feel this way in a restaurant. Maybe because of the ""pay as you like concept"", and most people don't pay a lot. The feeling is like you are there for a free meal. It is a nice place and I like the food there, I rather that they charge a fix price for the buffet rather than the ""pay as you like concept"". Maybe their 3rd floor can have a buffet corner where they charge a fix price. And people will be more comfortable there. I love the food there but I do not want to be treated like I am there for a bargain or free food.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Ordered the Okonomiyaki and was given a choice to cook by ourselves or the service staff. Since it was our first time at the restaurant, we chose the latter. It was an interesting experience to see the service staff prepared and cooked right in front of us. Next time we would do it ourselves for experience.

The Okonomiyaki has 3 indigents of our choice but were kind of overpowered by the cabbage and sauce favour.

Overall, an above average food in a nice environment and an interesting dining experience.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"This is a South Indian restaurant majorly, does offer North Indian cuisine too. I find this restaurant OK, can do a lot better

Note: the portion size is usually bigger than usual restaurants hence keep it in mind while making orders. We had to parcel the left over food.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Not so crowded place. Food portion is decent, music is forever Jay. Price is affordable too. Ate with 4 pax. And our bill size was about 72 dollars. Good for lunch! Service was fast too, very little waiting time, and ice water was a better. Choice compared to the other drink options. I was told that the jug of tea was not worth it. It's almost tasteless! Definitely coming back again for better lunch set. Its so cheap. As cheap as 6.90 only! Cheaper than my lunch area food. Omg.! Thanks N for recommendation",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Really enjoyed the food. The menu had a great selection of dishes, each packed with flavour and beautifully presented. The service was great, very friedly and efficient. Try it, you won't regret it!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Fantastic experience at this Japanese restaurant with good music, attentive service, cozy ambience. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Have not visited this restaurant for many years ever since they moved away from portsdown. Its still the best place to enjoy a good Italian meal 👍

The place is located just outside office building on ground floor. Just $1 per entry during weekend.

We ordered our favourite pasta and burrata cheese salad(come with ham) + bread which brings us back memories when me and wife will still dating.

The potion of the cheese it's huge and enough for sharing at least 4pax. The squid ink seafood pasta come with alot if ingredients and already de-shelled.

The service is still exceptionally good! They changed our plate and cutlery after we finish the cheese (starter) and help to keep us comfortable and enjoy our meal.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Went for our Anniversary Celebration yesterday night at Greenwood Fish Market @Quayside Isle. Overall food was good and we love the environment and atmosphere but was disappointed there are no more Resident discount.

Me and my family have been a loyal customer of this restaurant for quite some time, and I've always appreciated the discount provided to Sentosa Cove Residents. However, during my yesterday visit, I was surprised to learn that the discount policy had changed, and the staff's communication about this adjustment was rather disappointing. The person I spoke to seemed uninterested in addressing my concerns and exhibited a somewhat rude attitude. I've always valued the positive experiences I've had here, and the change in policy coupled with the unfriendly encounter left me feeling disheartened. I believe that clear communication about policy changes is crucial, and it would be beneficial for the staff to approach such matters with a more customer-friendly demeanor. I hope the management considers these aspects for the benefit of both loyal patrons and the overall reputation of the establishment.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"They are having a promotional breakfast set that costs $6.90 for a main and a drink. I was expecting the portion to be small and so I ordered the salted egg mayo croissant as a second main. But boy, was I very wrong. The portions are decent for an individual. The food tastes good too, and I especially love the achar like salad that comes with the croissant - it helps to get the appetite going. The laksa gravy is rich, which probably explains why they pair it with yellow noodles. It would have been better if they serve traditional Southeast Asian type of coffee instead of cappuccino or lattes. Overall, it's still an enjoyable dining experience. 👍",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Authentic Thai cuisine in the middle of a private neighbourhood at Clover Park. Walking distance from Bishan mrt. They also have other outlets. We had tom yum soup, green curry chicken, kang kong, pineapple fried rice, phad thai. You can choose the spice level for the tom yum soup, also comes in clear or milky soup.

Portions were a little small for the carbs but overall we enjoyed the food. Service was brisk and it wasn’t too crowded when we went for dinner.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Good serving size. Had the butter chicken, biryani, garlic naan, etc. Flavours were there and spicy level was mild. Yes, the region makes a difference in the spicy/hot levels.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Premium sushi chain - friendly servers, limited selection, and slightly above average prices as compared to other chains. Quality is definitely great, but would struggle to find the last star with the selection and price.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

Happy tummy with lovely atmosphere there.

Shall dine in again soon :)",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Was there for a post Christmas lunch and we had the lunch set which came with Trout. Presentation was really nice, colours were amazing, as was the restaurant decor and service was attentive.
Unfortunately we had a bone in the trout which personally for me, in a place like this, marred the experience. While the servers v briefly apologized i don’t believe it was genuinely addressed to my own expectations. Maybe a misalignment of expectations i guess - may give the establishment a second visit in future but just perhaps not yet.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Had stir-fried pork belly with rice this evening, and it was one of the worst I have ever eaten. I wasn't even expecting it to be sizzling hot even though it's served on a hot plate, but the food was like cold and oily. Will not patronize again.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Had an amazing time here chilling by the beach and celebrating our friend’s birthday! The staff were very nice and helpful— allowing us to change our reservation, helping us with photos, storing of cakes and even prepared a customised card and dessert for us!

"I went to the Soup Restaurant at Clementi Mall to have my birthday early celebration. I thought we wasn't allow to make reservations during weekend but call them to check and in fact I was able to so. Just had the scrumptious meal today and would like to put up few lines for the review. Very friendly and helpful staffs. I have ordered the Appreciation Set from them. Dishes came out real quick and we completed our meal in 1 hr. No rushing though, just nice pace for us. Dishes seems not too much or big but ended up quite filling. They have a good judge of serving potions to prevent food wastage which is nicely done. I like the soup and the samsui chicken very much. Other dishes were OK. Take a look at the pic attached.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"At Pasta Fresca Da Salvatore in Siglap, dining transcends mere eating; it's a symphony of flavors and hospitality. From the succulent Italian pork sausage to the perfectly seasoned wedges and delectable mushroom sauce, every dish is a masterpiece of Italian cuisine. The chef's expertise shines through in each bite, showcasing a careful selection of ingredients and skillful preparation. Moreover, the warm, crusty bread served with fragrant olive oil before our meal, along with the gracious offer of iced water despite not ordering beverages, exemplifies the restaurant's commitment to exceeding expectations. It's these thoughtful gestures that elevate the dining experience, making it truly unforgettable.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"I decided to check out Tim Ho Wan at Jewel for their National Day specials. The restaurant is decorated with a Hong Kong cafe style. Functional. The customer service is average. We ordered the fish porridge, abalone chicken tart, deep fried chili crab spring roll, steam chili crab bun, char siew Chan Bao. The porridge is good. So is their signature char siew Chan bao. As for the rest, it is forgettable. The taste is flat and bland. The spring roll is too oily and I could savor any chili crab sauce in it. The steam bun is also sparse. If you are hungry and all other places are packed in Jewel, then head over to this restaurant.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Food really nice +, environment is great+, staffs are friendly. Foods are so good to taste. Love the tiramisu.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Happy hour beer at $10++, wine at $12++. First time to this outlet, but I noticed the portion is smaller now. Had the beef don before at somerset outlet, the beef was done medium, but here it’s a little overcooked. Taste wise, still acceptable. The chicken teriyaki’s sauce was super delicious. Oysters happy hour going at $3 per oyster. Fresh! Will return.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Was here for a Wedding Lunch and pleasantly surprised by the well thought out vegetarian menu they served being a non-vegetarian restaurant. They was a good variety of dishes with my favourite being the 土豆丝 (Stir-fried Shredded Potato) in this starter. There was also a giant 荷叶饭 (Lotus Leaf Wrapped Rice) towards the end of the course which everyone had a hard time finishing. The staff are nice but perhaps a little too casual and sometimes rough when serving - bumping into things and attendees. I was quite surprised when one of them just poured the leftover peanuts onto the plate I was eating from. It was also crazy cold and parents had to keep carrying their babies outside to warm up.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Service is good, food comes at a great pace, the place has dimly lit lights, nice atmosphere if eating here for dinner, the food is delicious.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

"Coming from a GenZ, the music was definitely spot on and all of us were having a mini (soft) karaoke session while having our food and drinks. Since my friends and I weren’t able to decide, we called on one of the waiters to give recommendations. Least to say, it didn’t disappoint! We were encouraged to try food as well as drinks out of our comfort zone which we absolutely loved! (night king and dragon spritz) Other than that, the staff did not forget that we were there to celebrate our birthday and gave a complimentary chocolate cake as well! I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family!!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

"First time. Service was not bad. Redeemed new member free tomato soup and garlic bread, and ice lemon tea. These were great and I'd high hopes. Mains were salmon and shrimp and spaghetti (no complaints, nicely done), and New Zealand sirloin and spaghetti (this was frankly disappointing. Ordered it medium rare but it was so hard to cut and I had to chew it like a cow 🐮). For the price, I'd expect better steak but overall ok except for the steak. (A side note, iced water is available for about 20 cents which is quite pleasant)",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Good food, good service. Price is on the higher end but the food is good. Set menu may be just enough, so if your appetite is large, recommend you order a couple of more dishes.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"This was my first time at Pixy Restaurant.

The food were all made from the freshest ingredients, with seasonal flavours. The chef (boss) is extremely friendly, and the sole waitress complemented him very well, as a dynamic duo.

The Sakoshi Bay Oysters were extremely fresh and the Sashimi Carpaccio was immaculately grilled on the outside, while  juicy and tender inside.

Their Kagoshima Wagyu Beef A5 steak was accompanied by an exciting array of vegetables and sides.

Its Japanese Carbonara was very creamy and rich, and it contains top grade bacon.

A very good dining experience, and I look forward to return there.

"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Restaurant Suzuki.  It was truly an exceptional culinary experience. From the moment I stepped inside, I was captivated by the restaurant's elegant interior, which perfectly set the stage for what would be an unforgettable experience.

There were many highlights to the meal. One of my favorite was the aburi sushi, especially the kinmedai sushi.  The perfectly seared fish was expertly prepared with the precision that only a fine dining establishment can offer. What made this dish truly exceptional was the ingenious use of shouldering wood, infusing the fish with a delicate, smoky flavor that danced on the palate. It was a masterclass in culinary artistry, a delicate balance of technique and creativity.

Another favorite was the beef dish. The beef was cooked to perfection and melts in your mouth.

The entire omakase journey was a symphony of flavors and textures, each course thoughtfully curated to showcase the finest ingredients and the chef's extraordinary talent. The attentive and knowledgeable staff added to the overall experience, guiding us through the courses with grace and expertise.

This restaurant has undoubtedly earned its place among the finest dining establishments in the realm of Japanese cuisine. I look forward to returning for another gastronomic adventure.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Ordered 2 plain thosai, 1 Uttapam and 1 paper thosai and they gave only 1 packet of chutney and sambar even though I request for extra sambar and chutney. How to eat thosai without gravy?",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
One of the best masala thosai and kothu parotha I’ve ever had. Our family kept coming back here. Sathish also took good care of us while we were here.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"I finally achieved Pani Puri freedom today and ate a lot of them. Apart from Pani Puri, there are also Gobi Manchurian and Paneer Makhanwala, which I like.  Paired with Sultana Pulao, Mirchi Paratha, and Plain Kulcha, it was a perfect match and made me eat one plate after another.

The negative side that the management would like to improve on will be letting the diners enjoy our meals instead of rushing us off. We felt so stressed when we were not even done with our meals, the staff came over to clear away all the plates. This is very obvious chasing us off, just for the others in the queue to come in. There is no time stated for buffet. They should not do it this way. Seriously, I hope the boss of Kailash Parbat read this.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
Unique lamb hotpot. Soup is quite nice albeit oily. Ordered a few other hot pot items not shown in picture. Total damage for 2 pax (ladies) was $160. Quite expensive I would say. :(,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Ordered a fish burger and large fries at 19:40hrs
Waited and waited until 20:15hrs still not ready.
Upon seeing others had their orders collected.
Went up to the counter and verify only to understand ordered wasn't being process.
Best part.. not even an apology..",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
First time here. Good first time experience. Was recommended by people i met at a plcae just across the road. Place was fairly crowded with drinkers and diners. Crowd looks friendly though. Had a couple of beers just to soak in the atmosphere. Beer prices are standard.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"If you want to try out some good Japanese dishes at reasonable prices, this is definitely the place where you should go!
My favorite dishes are Garlic Udon, Scallop Dynamite and Beef Sukiyaki, they are very popular too.
Sake or any alcohols is also very reasonable compared to any other restaurant! I recommend Sapporo draught beer.

You'll definitely have a good experience and would like to visit again to try some other dishes.
They have surely made two loyal customers :)",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"No matter how tight is your schedule in your Singapore visit, you have to try the crab plate in Long Beach UDMC. UDMC is rightfully famous for its delicious black pepper crab, the plate that I ordered there. The crab is cooked tender, and the sauce is incredible. This was my first time eating a crab and I am definitely not disappointed.

I should warn my European friends that the price rates are quite high in this restaurant, the prices are excluding tax (US style) and no service in the restaurant is free (even tissues).

I recommend Long Beach UDMC for visiting once but only once",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Been craving for lobster rolls.
They said lobster are from Maine, but texture definitely different.
In Maine, lobster meat size are bigger and texture is a bit chewy springy which i love.
Luke Lobster meat is similar to Indonesia's lobster texture.
A tad to hard side without springiness.
It is still the best one so far, none competitor.
But compared to Maine lobster roll, average.
I've had way better Lobster roll in Maine.

Grilled Bun is soft and full of butter flavor.
Lobster is mix with mayo, butter and lemon.

Ordered lobster claw too, which is a disappointment. 3 tiny claws with shrinking meat for S$10 (in their photo looks big)

Lemonade is not freshly squeezed.

At least they provide hand washing station for your convenience.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"A gem at NTP Lorong Chuan. Easily access via lorong chuan mrt station (exit b).
Friendly service, good Japanese food.
Next ti
me to try their omakase, need to pre- book 2 days.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"One of the better seafood restaurants that you can get in the east in a very traditional setting. Food is fresh even for takeaway. There is a discount off the price on the menu for takeaway as the prices in the menu seems to include service charge. By the way, the yam paste is not too bad!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Steak and pasta super delicious!!!! Staff friendly and excellent service! We loved it and would come again！,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
I went there for the first time yesterday and liked the food and drinks especially the otak otak but what I think was good was how patient they were and never rush us or “show face “ while we celebrated birthday there till closing time. The staff  were all very helpful and kind. Rare to meet service staff like this nowadays. They also made food specially for allergy requirements of my daughter. 👍,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Serving mostly tour groups.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Asked the lady what fish they used for the seafood hor fun, she said snakehead, I don’t take fresh water fish so I told her not to put and make it less salty. Ordered the 9 to take away, when I got home and started to divide the hor fun meant for two, I counted 7 tiny prawns around the size of a fifty cent coin and no other seafood, was already disappointed but what made it worst was it was super salty, and why say seafood hor fun when only tiny prawns was inside. 9 for this!",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
Food was great! Marinated Pork collar highly recommended. Sarah was so attentive to all our requests.,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
"Ordered food for delivery after soending $$$.00
Received a message saying we dont have a driver .,,
With a photo of food on the countrr
Eventually food arrived there was no chutney for the chaats only the water for oani puti
All the chaats were stale snd ols
Asked the manager oh we get back nothing

Very disappointing service snd to be homest the worse food ever .

If you cant provide a service it should be told @ the time
Do bot send stale food when customers are paying alot of money
😡🥵😱",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Strongly recommended by a friend to come try. Indeed. Nice authentic Italian restaurant. Great healthy delicious foods and fantastic tiramisu. I enjoyed the nice cup of macchiato too! Must book to get a table.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Food quality and portion are big. Taste good but service quite bad. Short of staff and tables are not clear. Fruit juice, dessert and ice cream only 1 man handling and queue becomes long. Place wise is good especially now celebrating Oktoberfest",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Wide selection of fresh dishes, cheese dip, free flow Thai chilli  and other sauces, chopped garlic and chilli padi, prompt service, attentive staff and friendly boss. Just bring friends!

Also check out their collab with Rochor Beancurd House: Green Thai Tea Soy Milk, Soy Beancurd with Green Thai Tea, and Grass Jelly with Thai Milk Tea! I love the Soy Beancurd most! 😋😋",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Went there and order a set of ramen with ice cream and hot tea. Atmosphere is nice,family friendly. Staffs are nice and polite.

But there are few areas that I hope the restaurant could improve on:

1) the ramen soup was very salty. ( I don't know if it's my personal opinion, but this is the saltiest soup I've ever tasted.)

2) Dessert is served together with the food. By the time I've finished my ramen,my ice cream have already melted. ( From my experience dining in other restaurants, usually after u had finished your meal, then you request the staff for your dessert)

3) Hot tea is served in a porcelain cup, which make it too hot to even hold it. ( I could only able to drink it after it became cool tea 😭)

If all the above can be improved,I don't mind coming again. If not, this might be my last time dining here again.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Reasonable price and the steak is cook to perfection. Salmon fish was also cooked just nice to retain moisture content. Service crew was also friendly and helpful on the food recommendation. Keep up the great work and thanks for the nice dinner for our family.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Burger is slightly too oily but the taste is great, pairs perfectly with their refreshing ale!

Serving is quite slow, don’t go if you are in a hurry to catch a flight.

I enjoyed their hand washing machine, quite interesting.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Everything is old school here, including the gents.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Prawn paste chicken is very good! The soup for their fish soup is better at the mayflower outlet though but still decent.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Food was AMAZING!! I had ""The GIANT (Aust. Beef) 230g"" the meat was soo juicy and tender... one of the most tender meat I have consumed. I highly recommend 👌",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
"Fantastic Harry's seven! Happy hours go until 8pm, make sure you come before then!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Enjoyed their cocktails and my husband ordered their signature dish chicken debal which he was super impressed with, it has a nice spicy kick to it. Peter the owner was there tonight serving and was so personable such a great host, we enjoyed chatting to him. We sat outside and it was lovely such a great atmosphere. The prawn crackers as a complimentary entree was a delicious surprise. We'd definitely come back and try more food and cocktails! Awesome service too.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
"Service is damn slow. just to purchase take away for 1 bloody single food.

Never going to here again.

Should have just gone to Street 21 instead. Near block 208A.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"I have to give this restaurant a 5star rating. The quality is top notch - the wagyu cubes, scallops, fresh oysters just to name a few. And the aburi sushi are fantastic.
We went on a Sunday night and we were surprised that the restaurant was quiet. It makes our experience more cosy.
The only thing lacking is there wasnt any dessert, besides ice cream. And there wasnt even any green tea flavour ice cream.
Overall, Hokkaido sushi is highly recommended. Will definitely revisit.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Too expensive... Very unfriendly staff too, the basically very annoyed faces and very impatient... Prepare about $8 per person eating only 2 3 items...",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"We have waited at the restaurant for 30 mins, no food still. If you can’t serve within certain time frame, the restaurant should stop taking order. As simple as that.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
Wanted to order from a new place to try out. This was recommended from one of my friends and turned out to be a great choice. The food is authentic Indian and rightly priced. Can wait for Dine-in to start to go over to the place with family and friends. The butter Chicken and Chicken Lollipop are must try.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Good variety of food at about $2 per plate. Buffet is $30 each so if you eat a lot it’s quite worth it. Food is served relatively quickly, place is often packed but didn’t have to queue too long.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"South Indian food quick bite restaurant,  very little sitting space,  card only place,  courteous staff members,  reasonable prices,  beverages also available,  famous for masala tea.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"We had our solemnisation and dinner here. Really nice ambiance and photographs turned out to be exceptionally beautiful. Staff was extremely friendly and attentive. Service level was impeccable. We spammed the whole menu and everything tasted great. The salesperson Tony who introduced us to the venue was helpful and attentive to our needs throughout the whole process. Tony, the restaurant manager, the chef, all the staff, all worked very hard together to make our special day memorable. We are really really thankful for Path for giving us such a wonderful day!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Purchased 2 crunchy cones to take away.
The waffle cones were soft.
Brought back for an exchange which the manager changed.
Still end up with the same soften waffle cone.
Disappointing experience.
I was expecting that a new batch of waffle cone will be used for replacement.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Despite busy period the staffs are friendly and patient in assisting their customers. The ambient was so homey bcos of the people working at this outlet. Our food was on time and was really delicious.Keep it up team and the girl manager,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Good choice of dishes but very poor cooking. The pork slices in our ginger pork dish were cold, only the gravy was hot. The meat must have been pre-cooked, don't know how long ago, and the gravy simply warmed up and spread over the meat. Our order came super fast after placing order.
Another dish, black bean bittergourd was served much later and was piping hot and presented what we expected - food cooked to our order, not pre-cooked and warmed to serve.
So, it's your luck if you order common popular dishes which ingredients are prepped ahead and cooked en-mass with other customers' orders.
Dishes were very salty with lots of lard and oil. Cannot tell them less salt and no lard - staff taking orders told you it's no use, the cook won't care and could not be bothered. At one vist, we asked for less salt, no oil, our food came super salty and oily - better that we had not said, lesson learned!",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"This is what Thai food should taste like (to me, anyway). I used to live in Thailand, but have always found Thai food in Singapore to be a bit disappointing. Soi 11 and  their Thai chef seem to have got it right. I asked for my grilled pork salad to be spicy, and it was perfect. I’ll definitely be back to explore more of this interesting looking menu. Run by really nice folks, too - service couldn’t have been better.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Staff were generally friendly and attentive, but lobster was a big disappointment. We ordered a 2.1kg jumbo lobster grilled, but it came overcooked and the tail meat was so tough and dry that we could not chew on it. For the price paid, the kitchen should know how to manage simple grilling of lobsters… Spoke to one of the staff who said he would check with the kitchen to see what can be done, but he did not get back to us at all. Disappointment overall and will not visit the chain again.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Service by the staff was exceptional. It may be cause we were seated outside, it was slightly hard to catch the service crew's attention. But when we can catch their attention, they will give you their full attention. Kudos to that. Food was also wonderful and when we talk about Korean food, we will automatically go back at Chang. 👍🏻",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Swensen is one of our favourite dinning place but nowadays they employed all foreigner no doubt they still do what they supposed to do, however they do not present themselves in good manner. Maybe lack of staff or so ( especially peak hour ) Food taste is still fine but portion strink n some sides for meal not included anymore.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"A Restaurant with a View

The Bimbimbap I had came piping hot. It tasted great but there was not much meat in it. However, this was compensated by the free side dishes they provided.

While the Bimbimbap price was reasonable, the BBQ meats were priced quite exorbitantly. 100g for $35.

Service was good. Whatever earlier reviews about bad service seemed to have been solved. We were seated almost immediately and given a nice table. Service was prompt and responsive.

This restaurant has a reasonably nice view of the waterfall.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Parking is quite challenging here.
Food is just ok. Price is ok for such an environment. The western fish and chips is not fresh and defrosted quickly. The hokkien mee is too soggy, feels pre cooked in big batches.
The nicest is Penang fried kway teow",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
For years this coffee shop has always been dirty. Not a pleasant place to sit and have food without looking at how dirty the coffee shop is. The food is not too bad.,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Food - Decent. A little overpriced considering the portion size and flavour. My burger was served on a wooden board that looked a little mouldy. (picture attached, you be the judge) The icecream seemed to have shrunk in size over the years, and was already melted on the outside by the time it arrived on the table.
Service - The male waiter that seated us was really polite and friendly. Was apologetic when we realised one of the chairs and the floor below it was wet. The other male waiter (who seemed to be the manager) we interacted with was really rude and impatient (the restaurant was not busy) when we were ordering our icecream. There was also a mix up with orders a few times, and we had food/drinks sent to our table by mistake. Other than that, service was pretty quick in terms of us getting our orders.
Atmosphere - Nice restaurant with a good view. However, since this is a family restaurant, there will be screaming kids from time to time.
Overall, this branch of Swensens has been on the decline for a while now, and I think it's time for my family to stop giving it yet another try.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Beautiful place + great atmosphere makes this a good restaurant to go to if you're looking for a semi-fine dining location. The food was really good too, especially the beef cheeks. That said I had to dock one star as the lobster bisque we ordered was too bitter. It wasn't just strong, as they warned us. I feel that they had overcooked the lobster stock. For the prices of their dishes I expected better. But I would still highly recommend people to go here as the place really is beautiful and the service was absolutely lovely.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The service was attentive and the food was delicious. We had the winter menu so no pigeon dish but we especially enjoyed the chicken, marron, wagyu, and pork dishes. Other dishes like their bread with chicken butter and prawn caviar dish were also well executed. Chef, came to plate the potato dish which was fermented and probably the best mash potato we ever had. The two desserts: melon and caviar were lovely too. In the end they brought out a complimentary birthday dessert and petit fours.
All in all we had a great night and we hope to come back soon!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Restaurant Born: A Culinary Masterpiece Unveiled

From the moment we first encountered the unique touch of Chef Zor Tan at Restaurant Andre, it was evident that a distinctive culinary voice was waiting to be fully expressed. We've had the privilege of experiencing the inaugural menu and the second menu at Born and both were excellent. Every dish not only captivated our senses but also unveiled the depth of passion and innovation that underpins the chef's journey.

Born's ambiance masterfully intertwines a welcoming warmth with sophisticated elegance, a testament to their meticulous attention to detail. The impeccable service mirrors the very qualities of warmth, professionalism, and thoughtfulness that they exude.

Watching Chef Zor evolve from his time at Restaurant Andre to taking the reins at his own establishment has been truly inspiring. Thank you for sharing your unparalleled culinary artistry with us.

We wish Restaurant Born all the very best and continued (well-earned!) success!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Had a pleasure dinner with family at here. The true stars of the dinner were the Chinese Mitten Crab and Cod Fish. Each bite was a delightful mix of sweetness and savoury goodness.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Chance upon this restaurant on YouTube. Decided to bring Wifey to try out.

Ordered: 小龙包，水饺，bowl of Noodle, plate of vegetables, spicy chicken & 2 ice blended fruit juice.

Note: The ***spicy*** chicken serving is really huge...Didn't know prior. (Serving size is approximately 4 to 5 pax. They don't have smaller size). End up having to packet the remaining.

Nice food & ambience. Try to avoid peak hours or come slightly earlier to avoid crowds. No booking required and no dress code.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"4 stars for the food not for the SERVICE! Pricing wise it’s acceptable and food is great but service wise they need to reorganise their worker and work flow.
Firstly, waiting time for food is so long not saying it’s a weekend or weekday other tables that are later than us got their food first and when we went to double check on our food their worker replied “there’s a queue so must wait” okay fine we wait so 10-15 mins later the food is not here yet so went to check again and told them our table have yet to have any items on the table they seems to be suspicious about us not telling the truth so we have to went back and forth many times just to check on our food order.
Secondly, I saw they put some food items onto their metal trolley which belongs to our table okay so we assume they were preparing our food but they didn’t! They left the food there and serve other tables food first while leaving those sides on the metal trolley!
Thirdly, after such a long long long time we finally get our food and guess what the person came to ask us to pay for our food. Wow we wait for our food for that long and you want us to pay our bill plus on a side note they miss out some of the items that were on the list.
Fourthly, there will be a lady incharge of billing and she will bring it to the cashier. So apparently this happen we told the lady that some items were missing and pass her a $50 together with the bill and she said she will come back with the change but ended up the lady came back claiming that we did not pass her the $50 but we did! Then next, one of her co-worker wearing a sarong top came and said “you guys said you pay the money but where’s the money” umm hello lady how the heck will i know where the money went we definitely did gave your co-worker the money for our meal!!! She claimed that there is 4 person working so which is the lady that we pass the money to? Umm i only see like 1 lady working throughout the entire shift tell me where is the other 3?
Lastly, the lady who took the $50 drank alcohol with her friends. Wow mind-blown man clap for this place’s mookata can work and drink at the same time.
Okay folks that’s it for the review of this place go ahead and try and see what experience you will get
( this is not our first time there eating the mookata but it will be our last time for it )",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
First time trying out Hokkaido sushi. Nice and quiet place. Good ambience. Surprisingly the place was quite packed so reservation is highly recommended. Not too much of a variety but food was of high quality and service was prompt. Love the century egg tofu!!  Ordering system through handphone was simple and efficient. 2 pax for around $106 at lunch on a weekday. Definitely value for money.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Nostalgia brought my friends and I back to Porta Porta. The location may be different from the old one at Changi but the food and staff definitely bring back the memories. Am so glad the quality and taste remain the way we remembered it. Chatting with the lady owner/chef is like taking to an old friend or relative. Thanks for all your hard work!,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Amazing food! Their lunch promotion is very affordable with 3 courses. All of which had large portions and generous servings of prawns. 15 plus plus per person. Recommended to try their pad thai, sweet and spicy, very good. Even their thai milk tea is thick and not diluted. Their service was good too, very fast and efficient. They promoted their lunch promotion with enthusiasm.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Best,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Simple zhi char fare. Actually its quite good. I like the 甘香虾. The curry fish head gravy was very thick and flavourful. This could be my next favourite place for curry fish head and seafood! They are having promotions for crabs by the way ;),POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"If you are looking for a casual and fun Italian restaurant, this is the place.

It was surprisingly the crew that made the whole experience for me. They were friendly, attentive, could even get in on our jokes for a bit. Its a hot Sunday afternoon by the sea, you couldn’t ask for better vibes than this.

Food wise - Everything was fresh, delicious and beautifully presented. Nothing to fuss about! We were a group of 5 and had more food than what i’ve attached in photos. They were so good i barely have time for proper photos before we dug in.

Edit - i just realised so many other people here have sung praises for the crew. Seriously, great job you guys!!!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Was there around 2plus and we could get seat easily. First time trying the beef cheek today and I thought it was not bad! Very tender and I could pull and shred the meat easily. Have not ordered the salmon for quite a while and it was still the same. I like the gravy with the right acidity from lemon. Nice veggie patties too. However, the salmon dish might not be suitable for those who don’t fancy something buttery / cheesy. The chicken wings are still the best - must order! Ended the meal with my fav cake!
Got tempted and went to get the soy ice cream cone but erm - not to my liking! But, with just 50cents, you get a token and can go and have some fun! LOL",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
I like the delicious seafood hor fun. I will ask for less salt for Hokkien noodles. The staff is friendly and good customer service.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Tried the grilled pork with rice today. Pork was well grilled but was hoping for more flavor. Was hoping for some vegetables for freshness also.

What stood out was the soup though. It had a unique citrusy taste.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Portion is smalll for the price (referring to broccoli and the popcorn chicken). Wasn’t really impressed with the beehoon as it was so-so, when they seemed to be putting it as their signature dish.

Most of the seats are empty on Saturday noon but the staff for some reason want us to sit towards the side where many other customers are already seating, which makes it’s less spacious for us. Cannot comprehend, but just go with it.

honestly the food was okay only. Staff were overall friendly. Food was served a little slow.
First time trying and probably won’t come back for quite some time",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Was sooo good omg!! We had their white pepper crab, it was super flavourful and fresh! Also had the venison, the meat was very tender and totally didn’t disappoint for our first time trying it!!! Overall would definitely recommend this place 👍",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Went there for family gathering but I guess they are overwhelmed thus service & food wise not really up to standard. When ordered set, shld be 2-3 dishes first but it keeps on coming in & filled up the whole table.  Food not according to what we've request in terms of sequence so not very impressed with it. Before i start my meal,  the cutlery are not cleaned too cos the stain still can be seen,  quite disappointed overall.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"An amazing dinner experience where I was so impressed by not just the taste of the food, but the ambience and especially the service.

I felt so welcomed and taken care of right from the beginning till the end.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Ordered Seafood Pancake - thick with flour, only 1 pc of squid per slice

Korean Fried Chicken - Crispy thin skin, very oily but not what I expected from

Korean style fried chicken.
Squid & Pork Belly Bulgogi - Was I supposed to order either/or or its a combination? If its a combination, there's zero trace of squid, sweet tasting.
3 plates of kimchi side dish, it was good.

Blew almost 50 bucks on this meal.
Likely would not return again.

Edit: None of the staff understood my order.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Decided to sacrifice hawker food for Swenson as the weather is super hot. Had a great meal. Ordered the Caesar salad with deep fried fish bites, Spaghetti and chicken thigh in herb sauce. Meal $59. Food tasted ok but not fantastic. Service was fast and smooth.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Food is delicious!!! Definitely will bring friends back again.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Food here is pretty delicious especially the otah. However be warned that their zichar (non rice/noodle) dishes are not wallet friendly at all. Eg. Hotplate tofu cost $18 here.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Came for late lunch and watch the rugby world cup. Place was full 1 hour before the match and even when it was full service was great.
Had the Charlie burger and it was pretty good.
Prices are about what you pay for the area.
Overall not a bad place to come and watch a game.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"We really enjoyed the food here - the braised beef cheeks and uni Sakura ebi angel hair pasta were stellar, and the desserts were also surprisingly good (as we aren't generally keen on desserts). The pastry of the Paris Brest is baked fresh which made it perfectly soft and fluffy with a crisp exterior, and it's filling was a good balance of flavour texture without being too rich",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Good place to lunch at Tuas. Big portions.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Surprisingly decent food and drinks. Can vouch for the kothu prata and chilli cheese and pratas as well as the teh halia. Dosas are so-so decent.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Been on a hunt for Japanese restaurants in the neighborhood and finally made it to Nara (despite knowing about it for years - just never felt the motivation). Ok, this is one of those that is hard to rate - you know those that are not really spectacular neither were they below average/ or poor value. Think I'll leave it as that.",POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
"Ordered the sambal stingray ($16)- the sambal was good. The kailan with salted fish ($8) was flavourful with enough of salted fish taste and small bits of fried fish. However the service of a Chinese staff was a letdown. He literally slammed my cup of tea on our table loudly, startling me. When we feedback to the other staff, a nice chap came to apologise on his behalf. Despite this little hiccup, I wouldn't mind coming back to try the other dishes.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Terrible place! Ordered through Food panda and the food we received were horrible! We ordered Kway Teow goreng pattaya and nasi goreng paprik. The nasi goreng paprik was full of onions, no cauliflower or long beans! Tiny pieces of chicken. As for the kway teow...  it was just omelette plop on top instead of wrapping it, the taste for both was horrendous!! Nasi goreng paprik, but it was just heavily peppered fried rice with curry chicken!!! At least inform the customer if it isn't available instead of just replacing it with whatever! KNS, fitting for its name, KANASAI!!",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Haven’t been here for awhile and I realised they have renovated; thankfully the standard hasn’t dropped and overall, the food still remains yummy.

- Claypot Yong Tau Foo 👍🏻
- Prawn Paste Chicken 👍🏻
- Stir Fried Kai Lan With Garlic 👌🏻

Can be noisy sometimes due to the crowd.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

"Food quality is bad. Recommendation item from the menu is not available.

Tea is charge per pax.
services can be improved.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Please do not eat here. Prices are ever varying and quantity varies from person to person. Food maybe decently tasting on certain occasions but in general the quality of food is average for the price.
If you want good north indian food please walk across to canteen 11 and eat at the Indian stall. If you are looking for South Indian options do not eat at NTU campus.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE

"Had a craving for chat... typical Indian Nashta craving... just in time for some papri chat.. and filter coffee at Raj Restaurant
I often pass this place during lunch and it's always packed by office goers... evening it's another sight altogether... chill and relax with a nice warm cup of coffee in the evening... totally worth it on the chat front...Also a bar serving after 3pm weekday... and whole day weekends... so you don't get too frustrated after work...wink",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Good zichar carbs and drinks are aplenty.
Well trained staff.
The pig trotters bee hoon is shiok :)
Been here over a few years, Dungeon is always memorable.",POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
"Sushi quality is obviously not the best given that it's mass produced within a neighborhood setting. However, there was surprisingly a large variety of affordable sushi. At night before closing, there is also a 20% clearance discount, making it even better a deal.",POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
"Wow great value for money seafood shop;
We ordered 500g fresh prawn; a fish; and some other dishes for 4 people; great wok hey and the food service was pretty fast (almost within the first 10min after ordering)
Definitely would come back for more of the fresh prawns
——
Adding new photos as we come back",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
We had a really lovely and delicious meal here. Food was tasty and we all enjoyed our meals. They have huge fans to keep it really windy even though we're seated outdoor. One of the best thing was that they allowed dogs to be with us while we dine outdoor. Recommended if you're looking for great Thai food with a lovely atmosphere!,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Very good experience and the food was so nice and delicious also cheap,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Good place , food is not",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Great place for local food. A must try for tourists visiting Singapore. Many different dishes ranging from satay to carrot cake and even seafood and also many different drink options. Environment here is quite clean, but on rainy days dining in would be a problem. Numerous parking lots available outside. Prices here are not the lowest you'll find in Singapore but the quality is commendable.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Staff were all very welcoming and attentive. Menu contained mostly of elevated local food fusion with western cuisine. Both Hainanese chicken pasta and Miso salmon chilled soba were quite delicious and generous in portion. Unfortunately, the cappuccino tasted machine made while the muah chee was a little too sweet and lacked the chewiness associated with this snack. Happy Hours from 2-7pm.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Very overrated…. The carbonara portion was small. And the calamari was soggy. Check out the pic and you can see the batter is not even well coated. I had higher expectations before walking into PocoLoco.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Repeat or Not…Not. The queue was quite long around noon so decided to queue as nothing better to do on Sunday. The fishballs were on the smaller size but very nice and bouncy. The soup was quite salty but flavourful. I decided to splurge and get the $5 instead of $4 thinking I would get more fishballs, just got more noodles. Noodles were only ok. Nothing special.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"The restaurant offers scenic views, situated as it is in a park by the sea.

During my visit,  the restaurant was crowded,  though i must say they have a pretty decent system in place to usher in diners.

Surprisingly the queue moved fast and before long we were ushered to a seat by the window.

Order taking was quick and food was served in double quick time.

The food was only OK in my opinion although I must admit that the Vegetables in garlic sauce were good to eat and cooked well too.

I must certainly give credit to the staff and service crew who were quick and willing to serve.

Overall it was a Fast into the Restaurant and Fast out of the restaurant as well.  Pricing seemed really reasonable.

Menu copyrights Rasa Istimewa",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Atmosphere is great and food were nice. Especially their curry fish head and fried garlic pork. 😋 definitely will go back again,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Dropped by for dinner & there wasn’t a crowd which was great 🙂ordered the cheese and garlic flavoured with chicken korma, with a chicken kebab.
Naans were chewy and texture was definitely one of the best I’ve tried 🥳 chicken kebab came in a bread/pita instead of a wrap but it was delicious.

Side note: they have a huge variety of food on their menu and everything is priced reasonably!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Our first time to try the food here.the food was nice but the thing that impressed us was the service from Mr.Rayner.As you know restaurant in Singapore services are very normal and they just do their job even in some Michelin star restaurant.But Mr.Rayner service was exceptional and with warm hospitality!!!
He was so friendly and polite also instructed us to be careful and show us how to handle the hot sake.it’s a small detail but his service make you feel like you are eating in Japan.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The curry is nice, I like it better than Monster or Coco. It was rated as No 1 curry in Japan as per the shop. Tonkatsu could be juicier though. Will come back again!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
We had an absolutely divine birthday lunch. Everything was great and perfect and love the food!! Highly recommended.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Our number 1 choice to go when introducing turtle soup experience to our family guests🐢the soup is so good and they also allow a third to half portion of soup refill btw. Must eat with the yam rice! Staff are always very warm and hospitable. 5 stars🙌,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"My mum told me this stall have been here for many years. The foods are good, seafood taste nice and fresh too. The menu show a lot of variety and mostly in text, so to prepare to read through the menu as the prices are a bit on high side. However the portion are big and service are excellent. The waiter Mr Bon from Philippines can speak many dialects and madarine. The waiter and waitress serve us very well. The crabs is the star so prepare to pay for it. The drinks are expensive too.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Waited for 30 mins for my food staff was messy and dropped food on the tables and floors. Missed my number and took 5 mins just to tell them as they just kept ignoring.  left my food out and my drink cup was falling apart. I asked for table service and the staff walked past me I had to stop them and bring in myself. Didnt even take my number. Food was cold and stale because left out for so long. Table was sticky and dirty,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Food was really good! Much better than expected! Beef patty of the burger very fragrant, and chicken cutlet very well marinated! And the fried mushroom, super yummy! Definitely prefer this place over Astons! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 and very cute robot waiter 🤩",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Disappointed with the whole Korean chicken moment. Taste nothing and look nothing like the poster. You can see the picture attached.. Maybe the cheese fries taste like KFC’s and that’s all. Chicken burger came cold too. It was only 11.20am in the morning and they also almost got our orders wrong.. Ain’t visiting it again.,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Beautiful outdoor seating area. Great skewers at reasonable prices. Most importantly, lady boss is very friendly and accommodating.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Despite the industrial canteen setting, don't be deceived—this place serves incredibly delicious food at remarkably affordable prices. I'm a frequent patron, especially when I have visitors or during special occasions. The standout dish is the chili crab—it's generously portioned and bursting with flavor. In fact, I find the value here superior to many pricier, touristy restaurants. The affordability is a definite plus.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Chef Marcus and Chef Jonathan are brilliant. Their take on modern cuisine with a Singapore twist is spot on with their flavors and textures. The service is warm and attentive without being intrusive. An absolute win, highly recommend!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Before fight food! I enjoy their services since the food is delivered quickly and the noodles are amazing! Excellent advice for a time traveler in a hurry,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Decent place to eat on Saturday. No waiting because the place is very big. Fresh ingredients and very tasty chilli.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
great food at an affordable price! good for sharing,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
Nice and cosy environment. Staffs are friendly. Food is nice. Will come again.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Very bad customer service. Walked in to get take away. There were 2 staff on duty and no one came up to take my order. Restaurant was 90% empty. One aunty at least acknowledged my presence and that was it. The other person avoided eye contact all together. I never felt so invisible. Ended up leaving as clearly I was ‘not there’.,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Good view facing MRT station.
Western food. Wide choices. Good ice cream selection. Crowded during peak dinning hours.
**Found the meat was not tender in the curry chicken baked rice",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Avoid at all cost unless you really cant find any food around your area.,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Jubilee is a strange place indeed. A restaurant that's not really a proper restaurant per say. Looks like Safra wanted to maximise its rental income, so they simple compartmentalize the ball room into 4 sub dinning areas and leased them to Jubilee to operate as a restaurant! Good is that we booked 1 table and hv the whole sub dinning hall to ourselves. Bad is that next dinning room is hosting a D+D of sorts, so we had to put up loud noises as they had a karaoke competition for entertainment. Believe you me, wasn't that pleasant when you have to put up with extremely terrible loud voices screaming into the mike...not quite the SG got talent show!😰😱

Foodwise, the quality is surprisely decent and not the usual mass produce type of food. Out of the 8 dishes on offer from the set CNY menu, I would say only the last 2 dishes....fried rice wrapped in lotus leaf n the red bean soup with glutinous rice balls are so so. The other dishes are good. Tasty and generous in portions. I liked the shark fins soup and stewed abalone with mushrooms especially! (Ok .... No disrespect to those anti shark fins activists...its just my personal choice). The prawn ball in oat flaks was also brilliant...piping hot, fresh n crunchy. The fish was humongous! Also quite fresh so would have been good if it was simply steamed instead of cooked with bean paste sauce. Still good nevertheless.

4 stars for food and 3 stars for the 'loud' ambience. 3.5 stars average. Perhaps good to visit the main branch in Katong.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The iberico pork belly melts in your mouth, i kid you not, it’s super fatty, like 80-90% fats every piece but it melts beautifully inside your mouth, 100% perfect. The seafood pancake is not your traditional Korean pancake, it’s thin crust, crispy with lots of chives, so you either hate it or love it, we loved it!  The spicy chicken stew is pretty normal, it’s nice but no wow factor. We also ordered the semi dried squid with butter, it was tender and juicy, just the way we liked it. To be honest we weren’t expecting the quality of the food to be good due to the looks of their menu, we paid $151 for 4 which breaks down to about $37 ish per pax, I would say it’s value for money given the quality.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
Very authentic food (you know when koreans patronage). With so many panchan. We tried the sundubu and green onion jeon. Flavorful up to the right level. Service was well. They served us yogurt drink after meal as well. Price was very reasonable. Will come back again. Near downtown line.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Had a celebratory birthday lunch here - their lunch sets are really worth it! The chirashi was great and the fish was fresh, loved the concept of placing edible flowers in the mix as well. I had to order their famous uni wrapped in wagyu beef and it didn't disappoint - was worried that the raw beef would have a strange flavour/texture but it melted in my mouth and i had to fight the urge to order it again ($16 a pop!)",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Been awhile since we came to this Sakunthala and noticed the price increased significantly.
We always like the Naan meal that is served with Masala Chicken (can choose) and also the Butter Chicken is good too. Portion is quite generous.

Something to improve: seats arrangement. The space inbetween seats are very tight, especially for the 2 tables nearest to the entrance.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
I went for the beef intestines jeongol and it was just tasted like what I had in South Korea! Very authentic and delicious! Will definitely go back here again if I am missing the food!,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Our lunch today left us thoroughly satisfied. Here's what we enjoyed:

🦐 Tom Yum Seafood Soup (Clear)
🐷 Grilled Pork Neck
🐟 Fried Seabass In Thai Chilli
🦑 Stir Fried Yellow Curry Sotong
🐔 Stir Fried Spicy Chicken
🥥 Coconut Ice Cream with Red Ruby
🍹 Iced Lemongrass
☕️ Thai Iced Coffee

Their skillful use of spices in sauces and dips amazed us. While the dishes are fantastic on their own, the dips add a new layer of flavor. I was especially surprised to discover a hint of tamarind in the dip that accompanied the Grilled Pork Neck.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Should be the top 5 Chinese vegetarian to go to in Singapore. A veteran vegetarian restaurant in Singapore. All of their dishes are good, and not to mention about their service as well. However the price is slightly at the higher side but overall it worth every penny you going to spend. Do give it a try if you happen to drop by Chinatown!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Long time favourite Chinese restaurant, been coming here for years. Guo Bao Rou is a must order. Skewers are good too!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Other than one server who made us stand around our table, the rest of the them were superb and attentive. Especially love talking to a mature server who is enthu in sharing the food and services they are providing.

Food is awesome, tasty and one of the best black pepper crab we have.

Do make your reservation at least a week in advance cos is really popular.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Trying Bali Thai after a long while on 15th Jul.

Decent taste.
Service was ok.

But be sure to act fast if the server is cleaning your dishes.
There's still half of the food in the plate and the server wanted to clear it away luckily we stopped him.

Maybe he can asked if we still want it before trying to clear it.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Ordered maggie goreng with fried chicken and egg.
The chicken was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. The egg has a good toast at the bottom while maintaining a runny yolk. Only gripe is that the maggie goreng was undercooked, so it lessened the enjoyment. Still a good spot for a meal.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Paneer shashlik tikka. The worst ever tikka I had in my life. No flavours at all. The chutney as can be seen in rhe photo too much color is added and not at all a tikka chutney by taste. The onions was stale. Had to throw away the whole dinner.

The chilli mushroom was so oily it took me a second glance to understand if it is dry or gravy.
The schezwan fried rice was full of added color. Pathetic flavour profile.

Had ordered paneer tikka masala few days before (pic not attached) , the color added stayed on the fingertips till the next day.

This restaurant is using way too much color in the food hence the pics look delicious. Perfect case of ""Don't judge the book by it's cover""!

Deliveroo is the delivery partner and as many have reviewed already they have zero say of your food is late. The restaurant phone number kept saying busy for 45mins at a stretch. Deliveroo said we cannot help you contact the restaurant and solve ot at your end!!!!!
Pathetic restaurant and pathetic service!!",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"My first time here in this quaint ""underground"" bar with a regular. My expectations were low, but were blown past sky high. I was thinking I was stepping into an Italian restaurant, as the name would suggest, but was told to try the local food. With major skepticisms, I succumbed, but was very well impressed.

(My photos will not do this place justice)

Pork Knuckle Bee Hoon - very fragrantly stir fried beehoon made this simple sounding dish very complex and flavorful

Special Oyakodon - Non traditional way of preparing oyakodon, but also very flavorful and appetising

Spam fries (not pictured) - ""that's how you prepare spam fries"".

Enough said. will be back for more",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Here's what I ordered:

1. Tom Yum Pasta
2. Da Bomb Burger
3. Waffles with Fried Chicken

I'd highly recommend opting for the bundle deals, which cover 2 mains, 2 drinks, and a dessert. The servers were impressively attentive, and their milkshakes are a definite highlight! Plus, the outdoor setting is exceptionally Instagram-worthy.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Coffee-fair
Food- Mainland Chinese, individual cooked food, roast meat, Indian food , Malay chicken rice store and another Malay cooked food store",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Food was absolutely terrible and overpriced. Aglio Olio tasted very bland and the hamburg steak portion was pathetic it tasted like a mcdonald’s patty in meatball form and had no other sides but just veggies.
Total for this with two can drinks cost $42, vibe there was just the owner inviting all his other friends over for fun.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"In general, the ban chan or side dishes at this restaurant were well prepared and tasty. However, we were disappointed with the bibimbap and cold noodles as they did not meet our expectations.

One of the main drawbacks of our dining experience was the lack of attention and initiative from the staff. Despite the fact that the restaurant was not crowded, our food took quite a while to arrive at our table. This lack of efficiency was quite frustrating.

That being said, the dishes that we did order were all enjoyable. While there was nothing that particularly stood out to us, overall, it was a decent dining experience.

The aircon was down during our visit and it was really warm.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"3.5/5 Prata Kosong: Nothing wrong with the prata, its decent but not great
3/5 Nasi Goreng Ayam Kunyit: To be honest, this is pretty decent too but the downside is for the price, the small quantity and size of ayam kunyit received is just... sad.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Swensen's at Clementi Mall serves very good burgers. I've tried their impossible burgers on a couple of occasions, and more recently, the Classic Ultra Burger. The patties were juicy, smashed till they're very tender, and cooked just right. The secret sauce wasn't too overpowering, such that I can still taste the original flavour of the beef. The melted cheese was the icing on the cake. I also ordered their mocha, which is nice and not too sweet.",POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
"We were craving for prata in the area and remembered of this store that has been there for quite some time.

It’s a small no frills kind of shop where there is a Kampong vibe to it. Everyone know everyone.

We had masala tosai, cheese egg prata and Maggie soup which all were pretty good!

Will be back",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The place we intended to go was closed, and so we walked around and came across this bar. Was a little hungry so we decided to try their fish and chips. BOY WAS IT AMAZING. So glad we didn’t give it a pass just because “bar food ain’t nice”. Had sausages that were great too. Drinks are reasonably priced, and just a real chill place to hang.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The CKT is sinful, decadent and has the traditional flavours shining through every bit of the plate. Although just a tad on the sweet side but I ain’t faulting this one bit cos it takes a hell lot to keep the tradition and recipe alive and passed down thru’ the generations and for that the price is well below the premium this food commands. So the next time, I am just going to wait patiently  in line till it’s my turn to receive my plate at the altar of CKT.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"First time dinning here, tze char is just Infront of the prawning pond. I think I had one of the best fried rice today. It's very well done not super oily, awesome flavour and wok hei. Fish head curry is a must order, family took turn drinking the gravy after hahah, spicy lover I think can request the chef to add chilli level to it otherwise their standard one is very comfortable and yummy. Sambal sotong also one of the best. So good. 👌",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
"not much atmosphere. typical buffet set up. Food was of good quality; fresh! Sashimi were in generous cuts. Good range of sashimi.
4 stars instead of 5 because the other spreads lack variety.
food were a bit slow to serve at times but understandably since there are made upon order.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"I was in wheelchair when I went there for lunch. The seats were spacious enough for me to be seated at the green tables.
My mee goreng was delicious and they added fried chicken as requested.
My son's fried rice with chicken was also good. His plate was clean. Husband's mutton chop came with pineapple slice and bread. He was delighted.
We were happy customers. Thank u!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
First time here for the fish and the other dishes . Not bad and portions are relatively big. Well recommended for second visit. The customer service is good. The only sad thing is they don't serve a plain water free,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"For those who prefer spicy Indian food is good n good wide varieties.
Thali earlier have 3 veggie including crispy fry… but only 1 veggie which is potato given. Along with dhal , sambar n rasam
Need to be back to original like other branches
Must try when been to jewel Changi
Need to improvise on roti
Rice quantity is too much might ask for reduction if u think it’s too much so food will not get wasted .
I feel thali is not health due to addition ofnpotato very instead of other n it’s expensive of $12
Special non veg include 2 small chicken piece n 1 egg cost $18.50 felt not worth although which ever good served was good .
Can make it better like before same other other locations as this place more of travellers visit",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Straightforward Heng Hwa cuisine located near Tampines round market. Menu's avail in S,M,L portions. First visit. Ordered all small plates to share as we wanted to try a bit of everything. Had Lor Mee, Fried Bee hoon, Fried Tenggiri fish, fried caramelised yam cubes, sweet sour lychee pork, braised bean curd and pork jelly. Verdict: tasty, heartwarming, value-for-money Putian food. We arrived early on a weekend dinnertime and snagged the remaining 3 tables before they got busy with dine-in/takeaways from 630pm. Coming back to try other dishes.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
The chicken wings are absolutely delicious. Plant balls with cranberry sauce superb as always… salmon quiche so special…,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Hidden gem that you won't notice from the outside. But once you walk in the atmosphere is great.

Nice beers on tap and food is pretty decent.

Will come back here again.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Very unsightly atmosphere, tables not cleaned eventhough plates are cleared by customers. Customers have to clean the tables on their own to dine in! The tray return station are full of trays of plates etc thus prevent others from clearing their tables.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Had a lovely lunch here, though the outdoors is a bit hot but can’t complain with the beautiful scenery and great service from Mr.Guna. Totally enjoy the pizza!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
I only order at home and only breakfast. Great food and good value for money. Veg options.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Wonderful food, great ambiance and nice staffs!!! Definitely a must go restaurant 💕💕💕",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"One of the best sichuan/china cuisine restaurants we’ve ate at in Singapore!

We ordered the sour veg fish, spicy oil beef slices, roast pork neck meat, and pork dumplings. Loved the dumplings and the spicy oil beef!!! Must order!!!

Will definitely visit again :))",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The food not only tasted terrible, its unhygienic. Found a fly hidden in the kimchi!!",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Service was on point! Every staff that attend to our table inform which is which dish. They were accommodating and patient with us. Even gave us a complimentary cake for Mom, Brought my fam out for Iftar and celebrate mom's birthday.

Due to Covid restrictions, food is brought to the table instead, and food is just a click away from your phone!
Love that the food was served in small portion. So you know no food will go to waste! No dish was served cold except for dessert of course! Hehe

Every single dish was scrumptious! Overall, fam is super satisfied especially Mom too ... If you're into Mediterranean food... here it is.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Crispy and fluffy pratas. One of my favorite pratas in Singapore. Be sure to come before the lunch crowd.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The number of dishes on offer at this eatery is mind blowing! We ordered the Mee Goreng Pattaya (meat free) for myself, Tulang Soup for my dad and Butter Chicken w Rumali Roti for my mum. All the dishes were tasty, and reasonably priced. However, the price of the Lime Juice was pretty steep at $4.50 per pax.

Staff are very kind and helpful, so kudos to them for their wonderful service.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Just basing it on one bad experience. Rest were good. The one time I had chicken it upset my stomach. Veg? No issues there at all. The meals are pretty good actually,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Didn't know of this hideout and was happy to be brought there. Great ambience. Nice live band. Good food and most importantly it's affordable! Plus point because you can bring your fur baby along! Recommended 👍🏼,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Tucked away in a corner of Pasir Panjang, this
cosy restaurant should be familiar to the folks working at Mapletree Business City as it is along a row of eateries just 10 min away by foot.
The cuisine and staff here are authentic Thai, attracting a diverse clientele here for its good food. At my visit, I spotted an Indian family as well as a group of locals with their Caucasian companion.
The food is redolent with the spices of Thailand, imparting that flavor that tells you, if you close your eyes, that you are in a little part of the Land of Smiles, despite knowing otherwise. No doubt, the chatter in pasa Thai adds to the illusion.
Portion wise, the food is served in hearty quantities and speedily.
We could not eat fast enough - the food was that tasty.
Esarn Thai is definitely a must-visit if you are in Pasir Panjang!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"This branch follows the usual format of all McDonald's outlets, so there are no surprises in terms of store layout and experience. It is not so big, though. Expect crowds during peak hours. I've observed that the size of the burgers has gotten smaller -- sighh!! Another victim of shrinkflation. Taste remains the same, so at least there is a reason to keep coming back.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Tried the lobster rolls with truffles and the promo $8 pint of little creatures. The bread was well executed and the lobster portions were chunky.

Felt a little hungry after the meal. Could be better with some fries. The beer was good but unlikely to order if it’s back at $15-16 per pint. Not quite sure if there’s an option for wine as well.

There ain’t much seating at the moment, could be due to covid. Happy to revisit during off peak but will unlikely queue for this on weekends. Worth a try.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"This is one of those places that surprised me with the quality of food, ambience and even service. As a lover of Greek food, the search is ongoing for the next better one. And I  I have found this next better one for sure. As we are not big eater, the hummus, the ring bread (I suggest go for the non wholegrain one as it is softer), and keftedes (beef balls) already filled both our stomach. Will definitely be back here to savour their other dishes, especially the highly recommended grilled lamb chop, and baklava.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
"Happy hour oysters going at $3 each! Foie gras was decently cooked, an expected texture and taste. Though, I wasn’t a big fan of the Char Siew Unagi, would prefer the usual one we have. Else pear or yuzu spritz are suitable for ladies too.

Kitchen service was slow, waited 45 mins for the cooked food when we ordered at 5.15pm, which is kinda of off peak.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Lovely Lunch at East Treasure !

Well executed dishes with warm friendly service staff !

Will visit again !",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
Oh there is no more archipelago beer! What a pity ! Actually I saw the archipelago beer is IPA beer but only take erdinger! Good enough,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Mentaiko fries is off the menu!

Great service 💯 and not bad drinks 😊",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The crab omelette is amazing and a must have.
The tomyum is not bad, a bit more heat than your usual fare.
Had the mama fried noodles, that was great too!
I personally enjoyed their cool lemongrass drink.

Come early to get space.
If anything, I'd ask the shop to move the ashtray directly in front of the shop as that's where families sit outside in queue.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
"We ordered 2 sets of Japanese Wagyu beef and 1 set of Australia Wagyu lunch set. The Japanese set was better than the Australian set due to the thickness and marbling of each piece of wagyu meat. I think the $12 differences is worth it.

The usage of charcoal grill was a plus point as it provided the immense heat and smoke that had added the charbroiled, smoky taste into the food that gives barbecued meats their unforgettable flavor.

Occasionally, the sudden blazing fire from the charcoal added the extra fun experience.

Overall, a good place to visit for charcoal bbq meat!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Good,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Great Thai place around the area. With a variety of choices to choose from and at a cheaper cost. Fun place to have your friend gathering occassions.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Food selection was great. Had a good meal. However, do expect long waiting times. They seem to be understaffed.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Hiii! I’m not sure who waited me to the table and also took my payment (was the same person), he has provided excellent service!!! No complaints even though my truffle fries came longer than expected, but the service here won me over! Thank you so much to that waiter! My name is Alfred, made a booking at 715pm! Please provide a raise to that waiter if no raise maybe a glass of cocktail, on the house from Tanuki Raw 🤣",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Had the loveliest time here. Margaret and Shidah made it even lovelier with their top notch service and ensured we're well taken care off. Oh ya, the food here is just heavenly. I reckon the service we got made the food even nicer. Variety of choices, well ventilated, well-lit area and the food is well prepared too! We had the nourishing chicken collagen soup and laksa broth. I have to urge you to get the fish paste (in the collagen soup!) and prawn paste (in laksa). It is out of this world, ladies and gentlemen. So if you're looking for a place for hotpot for a great price. Suki suki is it. And it's HALAL!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Everything was deliciously marvelous! Fantastic blend of French cuisine with Japanese ingredients.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Great service here, staff are very attentive and nice. The food is yummy too! Will definitely be back.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Absolutely fantastic service and work etiquettes from the crew.
Often when it’s go time, people loses their composure and succumb to pressure. The men of Tambi operated smoothly and efficiently, making sure their guest feels comfortable. Certainly an underrated aspect of the restaurant.
A fusion of two different cuisine in extreme polarity come together unexpectedly well.
Personally my favourite is the Pajeon and the sweet tender ribs briyani.
Can’t say much about the other mains but overheard the customers beside us talking about the Lamb chops.
Definitely the next on the list!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Moments ago, I ordered butter chicken for $10 at the restaurant. I even showed them a picture of butter chicken and they said its the same just different colour. It tasted like zhi char's salted egg yolk chicken.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Excellent service and the waitress always check to ensure we have plates, or help us clear the wastes, monitor and serve the next dishes when we are done with the current dishes so we dont wait too long but have enough time to take a break. The food are fresh, delicious and the yam paste is super yummy. Will recommend the food and excellent service! Restaurant is also clean and aircon is nicely set.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Dinner Gathering with my friends. First time eating at a Shake Shack outlet (I kid you not 😊). Suakoo me have tried Shake Shack Burgers, but it’s the tapao version by hubs.

Ordering from the Self Service Kiosk was easy except for the part where I had to verify myself (cos I ordered ShackMeister Ale & Shake Shack needed to ensure I’m not under 18 😉)

Asked for help from counter staff who then gave me the passcode. I tried a few times n failed. Asked the same counter staff again who quickly came over to help me with the passcode.

Seems that different outlets have different passcodes, and he has just transferred from another outlet. He apologised for this, but I told him it’s ok.

I found the whole experience very interesting, albeit a bit time consuming. I initially punched in my age cos I thought that’s what they needed 😂

Ordered Shack Stack (Mushrooms & Beef Burger). It was really delicious! The ale was pretty refreshing too.

It was full house when I was there at 7.15pm. I wish I have gone upstairs. Cos after reading the reviews here, upstairs has nicer environment.

Shake Shack served complimentary water (self service) at a counter where you find serviettes and condiments. One also return the trays at the same counter.

I’m impressed that the service staff cleared the trays pretty fast.

Would I visit this Bishan Junction 8 outlet again? Probably if I’m in the area again. I would def hop upstairs the next time round though.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Great tasting food and excellent service! All the staff were so polite and efficient, it was a great dining experience here!

I loved that they have balonglong juice and it was so refreshing.

If you drive, there's a place to park right opposite the restaurant.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Staff was polite and respectful.Sourdough pizza the best.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
loved their foods. We enjoyed so much of their pizza. Tasty and yummy.  Friendly staffs too like jenny and  laarnie,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Father's Day Celebration was worth it here! Great tasting food!,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Was there for cny eve dinner. Glutinous rice was rather disappointing. In the small bowl, there was only 1 tiny slice of Chinese mushroom & 2 very thin slices of Chinese sausage. No garnishes at all inside. Maybe kitchen was too busy to add them? Rice was very plain without any fragrance. Told the male waiter that chef should give more ingredients and he replied that all were portioned out. Told him that was why should portion put more! Ate half of the small bowl only because rice was not nice at all. After 2 hours of the dinner I was very hungry that I got to eat the tarts they gave. Tart was a great idea and they were not bad. After that my son was also hungry. I paid $154 for both of us but did not get enough food to eat. Never like this. Sigh",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
"Very nice and affordable Malaysian style tze char stall.

I came with a friend and we ordered the San Lou Bee Hoon, KL Mee and the dry curry pork dish.

San Lou Bee Hoon: Very smoky. Strong wok hei flavour. Not overcooked to the point of being charred. 5/5

KL Mee: Slightly smoky and contains a generous amount of lard which elevated the flavour. 5/5

Dried Curry Pork: Very tender pork slices covered in Chinese style curry. 4/5

Both noodle dishes cost between $6-$7. The pork dish cost $12. The prices were reasonable.

I would recommend this place to tze char lovers.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Typical Chinese restaurant serving 四川烤鱼/Sichuan Grilled Fish in varying levels of spices & chillis. Have eaten in their other outlets at Mosque Street & Liang Seah Street before so we were fairly acquainted with the menu. Arrived for our 630pm reservation & was promptly shown to our table. Ordered within 10mins via QR scanned menu. Food/drinks were served pretty fast. Friendly service too. Overall, awesome flavours in great serving sizes.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Price adorable, food was nice, I paid for service charge and I know it was not much but I was expecting a nicer service, I saw the sign board of “please wait to be seated” so I wait but no one even say hi, they was busy joke around with each other so I walked inside myself. I ordered beef noodle which is usually come with the condiments such as a chilli and they dont serve it until I ask, right after I finished the food I have small chit chat with my friend and someone just collect everything on our table which I found is rude. Much better if you can improve your services. Thanks..",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Old school restaurant, famous for paper chicken. good place for gathering to taste local food. public car park behind shop. bus stop and MRT within walking distance.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Was recommended by Howe to try Spanish food here, had an excellent dinner here at Tapas. This restaurant is conveniently located to the bridge linking to terminal 3. Foods are well presented, taste and pairing was awesome. Excellent service, excellent food! Thanks to all waiting and kitchen staff for making this happen!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"While it's not a vegetarian restaurant, they have a decent selection of vegetarian dishes. Portions were good for the price given. Phad Thai was tasty abd the vegetarian version didn't have any egg or alliums. They also accepted our request to have a non spicy version of the vegetarian salted bean Kang Kong.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Went there as a small celebration with a group of friends. Service staff were patient and knowledgeable as it was our first time trying cheese platter. We didn’t know what to go for. Food came very fast and were really delicious.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Samy’s curry house is indeed a local legend! The pappadums are crispy, but also a bit thicker than normal, giving good texture. For me, they’re best enjoyed crushed and scattered liberally over the mildly fragrant biryani, which won’t overpower the other flavors on the plate. The best thing on the menu, though, is easily the fish curry. A masterpiece of fusion cooking - an Indian curry bubbling away in a Chinese clay pot - its flesh is fresh, firm and clean tasting, but nevertheless permeated completely with the fragrance of spice. As some would say, all the curries here “got power one!” and your tongue will thank you after the burn!

As for the atmosphere, it’s cheap and cheerful; a casual eatery with friendly, attentive service. Not exactly the place for candle-lit dinners, but perhaps where you go with your buddies after a long business meeting for a couple of pitchers of amazing lime juice or cold beers. Unless your date is also a banana-leaf rice aficionado, in which case, go for it!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"NOT HEIGENE,USING BARE HANDS TO SERVE COOKED FOOD",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
Our regular dinning place on weekdays for economical western dishes. Like this place because they serve pork. Their porklion is tender and delicious. They also serve nice crispy rosti. Generous portion too. You can choose your own sides and also option to add as a set. You can conveniently park at Heartbeat car park if you drive.,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
"Location is good. Right next to a bus stop back into town.

Ambience and vibe decent. A family restaurant with a nice decor, albeit the chairs are uncomfortable.

Food was good. Chips came out old cold, burger was good thought.

Service was slow, poor staff, only one person serving the entire restaurant.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Just tried a few dishes and found their Korean style fried chicken is not bad. They use boneless chicken and the serving is quite big. For Mala Xiang Guo, the rice and style is too dry for my liking. Will return to try the BBQ and other dishes.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The atmosphere can feel a little bright during the day but it’s not too noisy. It can get cold with the strong aircon. The food was good, especially recommend the paella!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Went canton at Bedok Mall yesterday as they have the tea break promo. It was packed, waited around 5 mins to get a table. Ordered my favourite shrimp mango fritters and egg tarts! Did not disappoint. The piggy buns are my kids favourite as well, too cute to eat.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Good food. Popular with the local crowd in Bukit Batok. Weekend mornings are crowded, you might need to wait a while if you’re unlucky.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
We sat outdoors and this place has super chill vibes and good settings for family / work dinner and networking activities. good ambiance and great scene! Eitel was such a great host and he made sure our tables are always filled with food and drinks 🤟,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Literally jumped off the bus at the next stop when I saw this place and ran back. I was thrilled to eat something so authentically flavored. The Bruschettini was perfect and every pizza I saw passing my table was gorgeously designed with a perfectly crafted tomato sauce. Cozy restaurant setting overall, for solo diners and groups, with hard working and attentive staff, budget friendly menu. Would visit again!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The last time I visited Neon, it was more than a year ago, and I remembered being disappointed at the quality and pricing of the food.

This time, I was pleasantly surprised because it does feel like they have found the rhythm back in their stride. The food was lovely, and the cocktails, even classic ones that we ordered, were on point.

The tapas generally were very well balanced in terms of taste. The outstanding dish of the night was the amaebi served with wasabi tobiko on top of a crispy piece of chicken skin. The combination was sublime, with the freshness and sweetness of the shrimp complimenting that oily satisfying note from the chix skin.

The hamachi sashimi was fresh, served over ponzu. The bone marrow with uni was done really well, served with decadent brioche, and just the right amount of savory and sweetness. I usually worry if the uni is fresh but the uni quality was exceptional.

The duck foie gras dumplings were yunmy, only complaint is that I can’t really taste the foie, but still a satisfying dish.

The chilean seabass was perfectly cooked with bits of crispy garlic, and overall a perfect ending to the meal.

They make a really mean campari sour, and their old fashioneds weren’t shabby as well.

Overall fun environment to be in, will be back.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Went on a weekend at 4pm and the restaurant is already half full. Queue starts at around 5pm.
Ordered beef yakiniku bowl (normal size), the sauce is quite salty for me. Gyudon should be a safer choice as it's not so salty. We were served with tea halfway through our meal.
Good price for dine in at Jewel.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"They have a huge hygiene issue. Not all plates and bowls are washed properly. I hope they really take some effort to wash. Other time I went and this time i went, the bacon isn’t fresh and I asked it to be changed and got a fresh bacon. I hope they will check the food before sending out. The food is nice but certain things are turn off as mentioned above.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Curry puffs - most tasted about the same , not much different. Crust is crispy but very hard.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Their set lunch starts at $15.80. Value for money, a must try. Amazing place to catch live matches. Amazing atmosphere during the World Cup 2018 matches. Opens till late.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Definitely one of the better Spanish food restaurants here. It's my second best Spanish food restaurants here this far. The ambience is rather upmarket.

We had the Galician grilled octopus, red prawn gambas, crispy tomato bread for starters. For mains, we had the crispy suckling with strawberries and the braised pork cheek rice (photo not included). Food is flavourful yet not salty.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Decided to try this joint after seeing a small crowd of people having their dinner here on an early Monday evening.

Overall the Garlic Pork Belly and the Lor Mee is really good. The signature bee hoon was ok, perhaps not as flavourful as one would think.

The only thing that was lackluster was the lychee sweet and sour pork which is far too floury to properly enjoy.

A decent place to try 👍🏻",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
"A-Roy Thai Restaurant serves very yummy Thai food! For the yummyness, you need to pay more for it. You need to have everyone present before you are allowed to enter as there are usually buzzing with people during lunch office hours.

We had Tom yum soup, mango salad, prawn cake, spring roll, red ruby and chendol.

The Tom yum soup is not too spicy. The fish and seafood is fresh and nice. The manage salad is appetising. Peanuts and mango are crunchy. The prawn cake has a sweet sauce to go with. It's fried but not too oily. The spring roll is crispy and nice with the sweet chilli sauce. The red Ruby and chendol are not too sweet and simply delicious!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Had an amazing dining experience thanks to Judy and Lai Yong’s exceptional hospitality! Their energy and charisma truly made our visit memorable. Highly recommend for anyone looking for top-notch service. Can’t wait to return!,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Decent Thai food with reasonable price. I personally love their fried “Kang Kong” and clear tomyam soup. Will try out other Thai dishes, green beef curry, pandan chicken, etc in the future…",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Only my 2nd time to Joo Koon outlet and very impressed with the level of service from manager Nathan and crew. I have not even experienced such service in Little India restaurants. I ordered the garlic naan and mutton and was really good. Would definitely recommend 😊👍,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Cheated by their E-Fu mian.Its actually E mian and had no vegetables or mushrooms the first time they serve it.We have to return the e-fu mian twice before they bothered to give us vegetables and mushrooms.Terrible end to a cny reunion dinner,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Good food/cuisines from North of India.. 😋
Must try is their Jhinga 🦐 Maharaja with Garlic butter naans 🫓",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Since we crossed the door, we were informed and reminded x3 times about the “last order” timing, everyone started stressing! We were x8, they proposed that we sit separated as they didn’t have a table for 8 ready!!! We fixed it for them in 2min so we could sit together! Then, when it came to taking the orders, it was a continuous back and forth and lack of ownership, I called the manager, he didn’t really care. The food was good, quality steaks and great sides! Such a pity that the crew messed up the chef and his team’s great quality work… this restaurant needs some attention from the management… good luck!",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Today, we dined at NAE:UM and ordered the classic menu of Episode 5 with both half wine pairing and non-alcoholic pairing. I must say that everything from the service, taste, to presentation was impeccable. My favorite dish of the night was the BBQ beef dish, which was extremely juicy and flavorful. It is probably one of the best beef dishes I have had in Singapore.

What impressed me the most was the amount of thought put into pairing each drink with each dish. The pairings complemented each other perfectly. One of the staff members highly praised one of the pairing wine, Joseph Faively, and that it is his favorite wine, and I could very much see why it was his favorite.

As a cherry on top, the staff left us alone after serving us the celebration cake, which was a great touch as my companion and I enjoyed being able to enjoy our own space. The only criticism we have is that the sparkling Jasmine tea was a bit rough on the throat and not to my taste.

Overall, I came in with high expectations for NAE:UM and left very impressed with the experience.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
"Utappam was ok. Chutney,  sambar was tasty.
Miscommunication in drinks order,  resolved quickly by waiter.
Gets Kind of Congested, so eat and leave.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Food portions were HUGE and the food was delicious! Easily shared between two to three people, the jjampong had a perfect kick to it and the seafood was great. The jjajangmyeon was substantial and the sauce was tasty. Damage was about $20/pax.

There were also GREAT OPTIONS for larger groups (yukhoe/sashimi) and I’d really recommend coming here with a bigger group to taste everything… I’m a huge fan, and would happily return here.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

"We are a group of four, ordered two wagyu burger, squid ink spaghetti and grilled salmon. Food is above average and portions are reasonable. The oreo and strawberry milk shake is so good!

"Enjoyable dinner!
Chai tea👍
Pani puri - pleasant taste! First time tasting it.
Mango Lassi - too sweet!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Found this place after many years! But I must admit that I was a little disappointed. The fried balacan fish was still very good. Crispy & flavourful. Just don't look at the oil :p. Crispy baby squid was the best dish of the night. Black pepper crayfish was 😔. It's dry & quite tasteless. Deep fried fritters was expected. The rest of the dishes we ordered were nothing spectacular. Perhaps I was expecting a lot more as it was one of my favourite Tze char places many years back when they were still at Kallang. Do make a reservation if you are planning to visit. It's very popular with limited seating.,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
We enjoyed the Modern Singaporean cuisine at Foliage very much. Please check out my Reel and detailed caption on Instagram at @veronicaphua,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The service here is really slow and lacking. Got the outside seat. Didn’t pass the usual bag holder that they usually still pass to us at every other outlet.

When asked for menu for our parents, asked us to use QR code. Reluctantly passed one menu.

Food was ok. Refilling of water is not auto and have to get their attention. But we do see the refilling of tea. 2 dessert (pudding) took way too long to come when it is getting empty. Not sure why",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"A bit too salty,but normally good taste with reasonable price,the serving speed was a bit too slow though.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"The food was very good. Especially the crab pasta (10/10). The bread is very tasty (8/10). The pizza looked nice. Dough & crust good, overall 7.5/10. Service is very good (9.5/10), all service staff were friendly, attentive & helpful. Ambience good (7.5/10), acoustically a bit noisy.  The table setting very nice (9/10), the table cloth has a pleasant look & comfortable feel. The tiramisu cake lacks the alcohol but still scores a solid 8.5/10.  Good price value. We will be back for more delicious pasta 😋",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Ordered Mysore Mutton (not in menu) 23SGD, but it wasn't having any spices at all, mostly filled with raw onion shallots. Totally like a bland food. Quantity is barely enough for one person, even after giving feedback, the manager doesn't care to check with customer and resolve the issue.
Ordered Masala butter milk and it was also totally not up to the mark.
Considering the premium price that they charge, their food is not acceptable, hence 1 star only. There are better restaurants around, people should try them first.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Was looking for good food near SGH and found this place by chance. Would highly recommend to come here for a homely Vietnamese food. Below are my unbiased review:

The Lemongrass chicken skewers are really tasty, juicy and tender. The portion is also big.

Eel porridge is special and taste really nice and comfy especially in a rainy day.

Chicken Pho has a light broth that still encompass all the flavours. So if you prefer stronger taste, you might find it bland.

Fresh spring roll is fresh and good too, big in size! The sauce that comes with the spring roll is also unique and tasty.

Pork Bun Cha is a flavourful fish with fresh vegetables, sauce that is light with a tinge of sour, coupled with the pork meat patty that’s well flavoured (but a little hard for my taste).

The prawn crackers has light prawn taste and not oily, those who prefer lighter prawn taste will like this one.

For drinks, Vietnam coffee is a little light; the lemon grass is nice but is sweeten.

Service is very homely and they are Vietnamese who speaks chinese.

Would be back again for sure! Thank you for the amazing food!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Terrible service with surly staff who kept getting a simple order wrong. The cashier is foreign (from China judging by her accent) and short changed me by $5 and when I raised it she shouted at me. Got my $5 back without so much as an apology. Food is mediocre af best. Will never patronise this place again.,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Celebrated wife's birthday and was a perfect choice! Chef and his 2 assistants were incredible, warm and highly hospitable. Felt like I was conversing with good friends and having a great dinner with excellent food together. They certainly know their stuff and celebrated my son for completing his national service by offering him shots of alcohol :) Highly recommended for special occassion made even more special by the IBID team.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
I was introduced to this Singapore landmark during a recent holiday.  Such a festive atmosphere with many birthday celebrations. Great food of the highest quality. The coffee ribs were out of this world.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"This restaurant should be TOTALLY avoided for being greedy, irresponsible in repeatedly reaching Covid rules. We don’t need such restaurants in Singapore even if the food is decent.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"our second visit, very authentic thai flavour! fish cake are homemade. padthai, fried rice, tom yum is a must try!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"A hidden gem of a place - it always feel special when you discover something by accident.  Restaurant Focal is just that - Chefs Marcus and Jonathan marry foreign ingredients and local flavours seemlessly in their offerings.  In cosmopolitan Singapore where you can find every conceivable cuisine there is, the flavours you experience in Restaurant Focal is different and refreshing.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"120124 lunch $6 / A very good bowl of Fish Head Bee Hoon. Was a little concerned of fishiness because the batang fish head was not fried kind... turns out pretty tasty with lots of vege.  Finished up everything.
They have other different fishes head n of course,  prices varies.
Might have extra MSG in the soup though because i can feel my face tightening....",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
One of my favorite places to eat and have a beer on a random day. Indian food at Barrels is pretty good and at a decent price. Also there’s always happy hour / promotions like Guinness pints for 10 SGD on Thursday’s. Staff is friendly as well. Very recommended.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"What a food!! I’m in awe.. The roast chicken with mashed potato and cranberry sauce is the bomb! Mushroom
Risotto And everything else are taste so great as well. The most important, its already Halal. Will be back here for sure.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
"Beautiful location. Great staff.

Ordered the Italian Pork Sausage, it was excellent.  First time I’ve had an airy thin crust pizza.  The sauce was also semi-sweet and not as tangy as most place in Singapore.

Will definitely come back.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Relatively new kid on the block. Decided to give it a try and I think one of the bosses was very friendly and courteous to the diners and was really making sure the diners enjoyed the food.
Quite crowded on a weekend morning even when it just opened for the day. Ordered the small prawn noodles, big prawn noodles and the big prawns zuke. Also had the prawn roll and the fried tofu.
The starters selection was very limited to only 4 items, would hope they can expand the selection someday. The mains serving was quite generous, and also like many have mentioned it's more on the expensive side. The broth is different from the prawn noodles and the prawn zuke, the prawn noodles broth had the pork ribs flavour as well while the prawn zuke was purely prawn broth which I enjoyed more. The serving for the broth in the little teapot was not a lot, and the staff came to give me another refill which was then just sufficient for the dish. Was a wise move using short rice also, making the dish very tasty.
I personally liked the fried tofu but the prawn roll was nothing to shout about. I guess the portion is quite big so I don't see people ordering loklok.
Good broth and good experience.",POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Truly enjoy the food and experience.  Every dish is cooked to perfection and the crayfish kway teow is out of this world.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Here for company lunch so no concept of the price here pls ignore my spending. Food is decent. Spread is kind of limited but sufficient.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
I ordered the set lunch. Mushroom soup was nice and smooth. The pork burger had a big portion and good. The meat was not dry and not fatty.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"We had a lunch in one Saturday afternoon after I tried sticky rice here. I was so disappointed that I ordered Thai curry chicken. The color is white and not green at all, suggest too much coconut pulp and too less basil and chili. Chicken also taste weirdly crunchy that I’v never anticipated. I wonder how it be prepared or maybe it was just artificial meat? The Thai basil rice, pineapple fried rice, and tong yam fried rice are ok, hawker center level.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Interesting location. Near Stevens MRT.
Place is very small - suggest to make a reservation.
The pasta is good! And my order came with nice big juicy prawns.

"overall service was okay, dining environment  was pleasant too. however, the ""heart attack"" pizza was lacking of flavour and in my opinion is slightly overpriced. mineral water was sold per bottle and was not really reasonably priced. nonetheless, the dining experience was somewhat pleasant other than the slightly pricey items...",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"My go-to place for delicious crispy prata!

Their Coin Prata was well fried with a good amount of crisp. I usually go for the mutton option but decided to try the chicken which was equally good, although much lesser meat.

The Masala Dosa was served with a generous amount of aloo potato and went really well with the sauces - well worth the $3.50.

I always order my favourite egg onion prata and to my pleasant surprise the egg yolk came slightly runny today! Damn good I hope they make it like this every time. The fish curry and sambal are good as usual.

Looking forward to my next visit already 😋",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Been here quite a number of times, the fish in Japanese grilled is my first try and I immediately name it as my favourite dish!  Seafood pasta is disappointing, too salty, and risotto was not as expected, not enough taste, suspect the chef accidentally put the salt for risotto to the seafood pasta :p

Nevertheless overall the seafood range is always good and never disappoint! W love the umeshu jelly as well! Thank you for the service team that make up our good experience!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
The chicken soup and the dried chilli mushroom are nice and special itself.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

"Seeing the steak restaurant next door priced at 32.9 dollars, I immediately decided to dine at Crystal Jade.

A bowl of hot noodle soup must be the warmest treat for passengers traveling on planes or connecting flights. For diners who don't eat pork, you can order the beef brisket noodles and shrimp dumplings.

🥩Beef Brisket Noodles
The soup base is reasonably rich, without any surprises, in a typical Chinese culinary style. The beef and brisket pieces are quite large, making it more satisfying than scallion oil noodles.

🥩Shrimp Dumplings
These are large shrimp dumplings, following the Cantonese style. The dumplings are a bit dry, suitable for quick meals.

🥩Bamboo Shoots
This seems to be a specialty side dish at Jade Kitchen, ordered by almost every table. However, it has a peculiar taste, with too much sugar, resulting in less saltiness. It's the kind of dish where you can feel a novice chef trying hard to cook, but no matter what, they can't achieve a consistent and flavorful seasoning. However, when eaten with the rich soup-based noodles, it creates a unique combination. It's a magical dish and a specialty of this restaurant. But at 8.8 bucks
the price seems a bit high, considering you get only a small portion of bamboo shoots, around 100g.

If you only eat the noodles, it might offer better value for money. Overall, it's not a disappointing choice.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

"Catch up with friends in Saturday evening. The staffs are friendly though we just walk in without reservation but they accommodate us in just fine while other customer hasn't arrived, that's the spirit.

We were served immediately by the waiters walking us through menu and recommendation, that is really warmth service. We had the house courses and herbs chicken along with juices and of course, a latte for myself.

Had a great time spending there chit chat with friends and we can see the restaurant is actually full house. The waiters keep doing rounds to serve us water to keep us comfort, kudos to that! Keep up the great work and the services!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

"Very disappointing, quality is worse than hawker center and staff not very happy to serve. Ordered a simple rice meal with 2 curries and a veg, plus mutton.

Can not forgetful about this restaurant’ “Wang Bu Liao “ Fish. What a nice fish I ever eat. It is Very fresh and delicious.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
I’m usually very blur so aunties always scold me. But the auntie here never scold me. NICE AUNTIE!!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Highly recommend this place for wedding for small (70-100)pax weddings. We had our wedding here in July and it was great!

Food: The restaurant allowed us to customise our own menu. All the dishes on the actual day were luxurious and delicious. The portions were generous and the presentation of the dishes were a feast for the eyes. Our guests loved the food!

Cost: The cost per head of S$150++ was really worth it for the quality and quantity of our seven course meal. The minimum spend required for booking the whole venue is also a reasonably achievable amount for a small wedding.

Coordination: The floor manager Doris Wong was helpful, accommodating, and kind. She helped us iron out many stressful hiccups before and during the wedding, and we are really grateful for her to help to create a smooth-sailing night.

Flexibility: The venue allowed us to rent our own sound system, set up a band, and do our own decorations.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Food is average . The beef cheeks is gamey , thankfully there is potato mash to help cover its taste . Next time I will just order their fish and chips instead. I couldn’t finished the cheese cake as it is not nice . The students inside tries their best to serve you inside the cafe but they forgot to serve me my coffee when my desert comes . The manager did apologise when he realise that they did not serve me the coffee which I ordered . Keep up the good work students 💪🏻 price is reasonable for set lunch with soup , main dish , desert and coffee .",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Was at Swensen's West Mall for dinner this evening. Tried redeeming my birthday evouchers, and Cathy was very patient in explaining the redemption process to me. Throughout the dinner, I noticed that Cathy was very diligent, and was attentive & provided good customer service to the diners. Food was also served fresh and fast. Overall was a great dinning experience and will visit again!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"We tried the Wanzhou Old School Grilled fish and the Grandma braised meat. Both dishes super wonderful. Really nice. For the grilled fish, they pour a small glass of liquor to it and the light it up for the extra flavor. The chili that goes with the braised meat was nicely blended and really help to complement the meat and bring out the flavor without overpowering it. Nicely done!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Since they have new menu in Q3 2023, I finally visited the place. Better food quality, improved service. My friend and I really like it. Will definitely returned again.",POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
First and last time. The $13 bowl of fish (including service charge) soup is half the size of a normal bowl and the armount of fish is equivalent to 2 slices of what you'll normally get in other places.,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Ordered the dinner set, price was worth the portion.
Mango salad was so fresh but could have had more dressing.
Crab cake was delicious, one of the better ones we had.
Steak we ordered medium rare and perfectly cooked it came.
It was my wife’s birthday and I told the service staff Praba at the last minute and he still was able to make arrangements. Really thankful for him going the extra mile.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"We were so excited to eat so the photos are taken when we were halfway in. We chanced upon this place after work nearby - We ordered 2 Tempura udon (which includes fried tempura ebi, salmon, pumpkin and some enoki mushroom), dragon boat maki and a yuzu sake. The udon was amazing, soup tasted really light but flavourful with the hint of the mushroom. Noodles were cooked to a good texture and the tempura was not too oily at all! It was really comforting on a cold rainy night. My partner seldom finishes soup in soup dishes but he DEMOLISHED the whole udon.

The dragon boat maki was amazing as well, the ebi was cooked so nicely (not too oily, flour was not too much) and the salmon on it was a great addition. Very well blended taste and honestly i’m still thinking about it 😋🤤

We initially wanted to order  highball to try, but the lady boss (I assume) recommended us a yuzu sake that she had just brought in. It turned out really good and went so well with the food we ordered! She got another glass of sake (which she additionally shared with us it’s of a higher tier that is also yuzu but sweeter) That one was 🤩🤩🤩❤️❤️ I wanted to find out what brand/type was it but she was busy. (She offered as goodwill too cause another waiter accidentally spilled my glass while he was cleaning up, hope he didn’t get scolded too much for it!!! Hahaha)

We were also then served barley tea FOC - she mentioned it was refreshing after drinking alcohol and she was right. Commendable that she is very familiar with providing her customers the best experience there. Would recommend and definitely will come back again!! It’s just 3 mins walk from lorong chuan MRT exit B. Super convenient. I have also noticed there’s a lot of regular customers coming in. Not sure about the sashimi and chawamushi, but I will definitely try it again when i’m back. 🤩",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
"Really great Spanish food at reasonable prices. I especially liked the grilled iberico pork secreto, the aubergine with honey, and the seafood paella. Service was good and staff were friendly. I’ll definitely be back to try their other dishes soon!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Food range is amazing, food equality is slightly above average. Down side that there are peak periods which will be hard to get seats during. But other than that, an often patron.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Nice ambience - the room was well decorated with Christmas carols and accompanied with Christmas carols. Delicious food - the food items on the menu did not disappoint us at all. Great service - thank you Kenny Yeo and the staffs for providing such great service.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Ordered on Deliveroo and food arrived 50min late. Contacted Deliveroo but they said delivery handled by restaurant so was unable to track and also unable to contact restaurant. Finally food arrived after 50min late. Overall quality is ok still warm but naan was understandable soggy as it was wrapped in foil.,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"their coffee pork was the best to be, but prices have gone up, size of each piece has gotten smaller… the sambal kang king is still delicious",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
"Crab could have been fresher, but overall still a good meal. Salted egg veg and their dramatic sweet & sour pork is something I’d gladly order again when I return.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"staff on site were cold and unwelcoming and seemingly more interested in their own conversations than helping customers. i was trying to pay but the two workers at the cashier in front of me were js chit chatting, i was standing there for 2 mins js looking at them before a third worker came to take my payment. other than that, it was my first time in awhile eating onsite at pizza hut so i was unsure of what to do, but the worker who was in the dining area was very short and cold with his answers and made the whole experience so much more unpleasant. not sure abt other pizza huts, but dont go to the one at bedok mall. not worth the money as it is expensive + horrible service.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
"Loves the soup. The soup has good variety and tasted really good. The restaurant is very generous, offering a one time free refill of soup. One can just have the soup and rice as the soup is very nutritious.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
50% discount Wagyu don is totally doesn’t worth it. The beef meat is difficult to bite and the taste is bad. The green tea is very hot and you can’t hold the cup for long. Won’t come back again.,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"we had dinner here on 10 jan, and was served by the male manager. he was very friendly, helpful and efficient, making our meal here a very enjoyable one! the food was also very good.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"My husband had visited this restaurant today to get a takeaway, was outstanding and good. The person who took the order was really helpful in choosing my menu items as I had shell fish allergy. He even made sure to pack the condiments separately for me as I had shell fish allergy. The signature dish we tried was fish fillets in a slight curry, tasted scrumptious. We order Kang Kong , spring roll , Thai fried rice, signature fish and tom yum fried rice. Every dish was exceptionally good and delicious. I am definitely coming back here for my future Thai food cravings. My husband was flabbergasted by the experience as well. One of the best Thai food I have ever eaten at Singapore. Hands down the best!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"I simply love this place and got to visit only days after the latest COVID restrictions got eased a bit. 3 years ago this restaurant want buzzing, this time it was a lot more quiet but with the quality of the food here - no doubt they will be back in no time.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Very fresh & yummy seafood. Ordered many dishes & all of them didn’t fail to impress. Will definitely be back for more =D!,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Ordered first time to try this new restaurant suggested by my friend. Good and tasty food at affordable price. The dishes tasted great especially their grilled chicken, fried rice and mutton soup. Nice to have new Indian food choice in Jurong area. Hope to visit and dine-in to try more soon as the restrictions lifted. Highly recommend 👍👍👍",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"If you want GOLD CLASS BRIYANK, come down to Swan Lake Branch! Not only food is good & value for money, I like their service staffs here. Never fails to greet & served with a smile!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"A reasonably priced restaurant with good tasting Chinese food. The oil soaked croaker fish was super crispy. We crunch crunch crunch almost every part of the fish. The sauce was not too salty and just nice to eat on its own without rice. The braised brinjal was really flavouful and umami, best to eat with rice. Will definitely go back again.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Inconspicuous. Surprisingly yummy, had the fried steak & gravy set. I enjoyed the ambiance!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Quick and attentive service. Drink orders came straight away after ordering off the online menu (scan from QR code). $10 pints all day is something they promote.
Food also came quickly. Big portions so make sure you come with a good appetite. We got the Fat Basterd and Philly Cheesesteak, both were really delicious and juicy. We also got Jalepeño Poppers as a starter which came with a chipotle mayo dip.
Everything was fresh, hot and tasty.
Service staff were observant and polite, clearing and serving promptly.
Vibe in the restaurant was nice and chill, old school rock music, chic decor.
Close to the Upper Thomson MRT Station, street parking right in front but mostly taken.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Ordered dark chocolate sea salt frappe. It's too salty and sweet. Asked the manager and her reply was that the beverage is made from premix, the proportion cannot be changed.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Thumb ups for this Hong Kong Cantonese-style Seafood Restaurant. Credits to their food quality, quantity and staff service.

Mr Adriano Lance,  Business Development Manager,  was very helpful, flexible & accommodating to my 👪family needs.

Accessible by public transport and carpark lots are readily available.

Our overall experience : 👍👍👍👍👍 and we will return for more 😄😄😄😄😄",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Great food especially the pho and the wings. They are heavenly. Seems like they do not serve fresh spring rolls. I dun quite fancy the fried ones.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"While not all my family shared the same views and taste, I like the food and location. Fortunately it was a cloudy day, so I felt just nice at lunch there.
The public carpark was a bit far for my elderly parent. Is there a carpark at the premise although I doubt based on what I see.
Overall, a lazy afternoon there. Walk along east coast beach after lunch is so so relaxing",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Ordered the butter chicken, dhal with the naan set. The chicken was tender and tasty, and the naan served hot and fresh. The briyani and egg fried rice were also tasty and moist!

The servers were also really attentive and served us well. However, the seating was a bit cramped with a full house. An otherwise pleasant experience.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
This is such a hidden jem. You could get indian gravies with great taste and quality at a very low price. And they have a lot of varieties as well.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Had a good dining experience about two to three years ago during the Covid period. Came back to Pixy for the second time for dinner.

We ordered three dishes - bouillabaisse, grilled iberico pork collar and grilled squid, squid ink risotto. In general, the taste of the dishes is decent but we had some issues with the freshness and texture of the ingredients.

The bouillabaisse consist of two pieces of cuttlefish tentacles, one scallop, two prawns, three pieces of mackerel and some clams. Some of the ingredients wasn’t fresh and we highlighted it to the chef. He claimed that the prawns were frozen. The taste was definitely not sweet (menu indicated that it’s sweet prawn) and was mushy. The clams tasted bland, overcooked and soft. This dish is a chef’s recommendation but I definitely wouldn’t recommend it.

The taste of the grilled iberico pork collar was nice but it was at least 50% fat. Have tasted many iberico pork collar before but never this fat. The accompanying sides were decent.

The grilled squid was nicely done. However the risotto’s in the grilled squid was like a paste.

Overall the ambiance and service was nice but all the three dishes were underwhelming. It’s also unusual that a restaurant of that size has only one chef and one server on a Saturday evening.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
Initially food is great. Slowly standard drop. Last i visited and i got really cold dishes. Probably not coming back anymore.,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"AMAZING JOKBAL that comes with a side of bibim naengmyeon and soup!! service was amazing too, and they were super accommodating to all my requests :”) will highly recommend!!! Was a super yummy dinner spot and all my friends enjoyed the food thoroughly! (In their words the jokbal was BUSSIN BRO hahah!)",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"We felt that it is pretty expensive considering that it cost almost $400 although there was neither fish nor crabs. The desserts were a letdown and not worth ordering. Yam paste served initially were not warm and we requested them to change it. The chicken wings were very ordinary and I thought a fast food restaurant can offer a better quality. To sum it up, it’s very unlikely we will return.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
Great vegetarian indian food! Staff was friendly even when we were not very familiar with the menu.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Went during lunch hour and ordered famous white beehoon and silver fish spinach soup. Beehoon is delicious and rich in gravy. Spinach soup is a total disappointment. It taste like salt water instead of the broth soup.  Spinach is old and hard to chew. Will not recommend the soup at all. Price is reasonable at $8.50 for a plate of beehoon and $6.50 for the spinach soup. No GST or Service charge. Will recommend to packet instead of dining in as the bad ventilation in the express restaurant will makes you smell bad after leaving the place.,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"One of the worst dim sum I had for the price range. Cheong fun is the worse, skin is hard and I can only taste soy sauce. My boy even commented that it tasted like spring roll. Roast pork bun skin is thick with little meat. Lastly, chilli sauce is horrible. Only century egg congee is lightly better. Never order the rice bun shown in the picture. It is the worst of all. For the price, I would expect much higher standard. Disappointed.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Last night's dining experience at Rhubarb was amazing. The dishes were a brilliant blend of innovation and taste, showcasing Chef Paul's passion and expertise. Each plate was a visual feast, with flavors that surprised and delighted beyond expectation. The service team was the epitome of professionalism, exuding warmth and friendliness that made the cozy and elegant setting even more inviting. It is rare to find a restaurant where the ambiance harmonizes so well with the high standards of the culinary creations. This dinner wasn't just a meal; it was a memorable journey through exquisite tastes and textures. Rhubarb certainly deserves more than a mere one star. Thank you to Chef Paul and the entire staff for an unforgettable evening.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Tried this place for the first time after reading some of the online reviews and checking out menu. As you can read from the multiple reviews here on Google, the food is good with a wide variety of items available. Unfortunately, they really struggle with the service element. In wanting to be specific, the general service was ok for me. Just 2 things really left a sour taste in my mouth after the delicious meal:

1. Communication: when ordering drinks, I had asked my server if plain water was chargeable. What I understood from him was that as long as the table purchased some form of drinks, e.g. tea, water would be complimentary. We thus believed this to be so until the bill came and the cashier said that I was misled and didn’t have the courtesy to waive the 3 cups of plain water we ordered.

2. Pushiness in ordering: as it was my first visit and not knowing the portioning of food in terms of small, medium and large dishes, I had to rely on the order-taker to guide me in terms of what was enough for our table. Unfortunately, even when I thought enough was ordered, she still tried to nudge me to order more and dessert as well. I drew the line before dessert and true enough when the food started coming, it was overwhelming. When we tried to cancel items that had not arrived, we were not allowed to. By the end of the meal, we had to takeaway 3 almost-untouched dishes to prevent wastage of food.

For first timers, do double or triple check if unsure about what is chargeable, and go with your gut instinct rather than just trusting the order-taker to order more than sufficient.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
Excellent service and vegetarian food was amazing!!! Highly recommended.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Been to a few outlet but never once left a review but this outlet is different, it worth a visit and money you spend.

Cant remember the Chinese lady name (will update in my next visa it), she just so sweet and very attentive to children especially for parent who dining here. Well done. Keep it up the good work. 🫰🏻",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Personally have never been a big fan of Raffles Town Club, especially with the ethical sagas that they have been put through in the past. Irregardless, find them very stuffy vs the newer Private Members Clubs in Singapore. Likewise, Miyabi, being the mainstay Japanese restaurant of Raffles Town Club, has this air of gloominess, age, and staleness the moment you walk in.

Coupled with the fact that only members can access the restaurant, there's automatically a discrimination towards a certain cluster of target audience.

It's probably good for family gatherings on the weekends, as you have private access to a teppanyaki space for yourselves. Prices are reasonable too, for the amount of food they serve as part of their teppanyaki sets. Get the lobster and beef set menu, and you should be sorted for the evening.

Food quality is good but not great. All else accounted for, I'm sure there are better Japanese restaurants around Singapore. This space reminds me of it being run like a passion project, not like a competitive f&b business in Singapore.

If you're looking for a space to chat and talk as a family dinner, this may not be for you, as you'll be sitting quite far away from each other, surrounding the teppanyaki hotplate. Go find your traditional sit down round tables.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"First time here. Made a Saturday lunch reservation which was confirmed via email by the Asst Mgr. Imagine my surprise when we arrived and was told that they do not have our reservation. Luckily, the place was empty except for us and another party.

We had menu 2. Food was tasty and comparable to similar items served in more atas cafes but at a discounted price. For soup, we were served with a chipped porcelain spoon. Please have the server check all cutlery before serving.

For the bakery located outside, it is advisable to have the payment and packing at the same location. The baked goods that I bought did not tally with the ones I received. They packed the baked goods behind the counter, bring it to the restaurant cashier for check-out. Customer will then procced to pay. There should be a verification step with customer to show them what was purchased.

Overall, I would return to try the dinner menu. Best of all, there's free parking on site. Everyone, pop by and give this place a try.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The most horrible food. We ordered paratha, kachori and chola kulcha.
The kachori was stale and it seemed it was older than a week. The paratha were maid of maida and lacked taste. We had it throw the whole food. Disappointing!",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
Waited 30 mins + for claypot rice. Turns out its just cooked plain rice heated up in a pot. Not worth the wait,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
Vegetarian food cheap and good,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Good Indian food. Pre call order also available,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Ordered takeaway on a Sunday evening and waited one full hour despite placing our order at 625pm. The lady did warn us that the waiting time is 60mins before I placed our order so I guess that was somewhat fair.

However, none of the dishes was worth the hour’s wait. Food was very mediocre and super overpriced. The ten boxes in the photo was $184.

We had ordered Medium sized French Bean with Shrimp ($28!!!) and Medium Claypot tofu ($20+). There were barely any tofu and it was mostly gravy. The medium Prawn Paste Chicken was also $20+ for 9 pieces and the store didn’t have boxes with holes that allowed the hot steam from fried food to escape, so our wings were soggy and sad. The duck rolls which were supposedly a speciality at the shop was also odd tasting and didn’t really stand out for us.

Carbs wise, we got the medium egg Hor fun and medium crispy noodles. I don’t think there was much wokhey in the noodle dishes and it was pretty forgettable.

I would not recommend this place to anybody. You can easily get better, faster and cheaper Zichar at probably any other shop.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Homely zichar restaurant nestled in a quiet corner in International Plaza.

I particularly enjoyed the salt and pepper pork ribs, beef bites, and the claypot sliced fish, amongst many others!  The claypot chicken is their specialty and its super tender and fragrant!   Would recommend!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Same familiar magic of allium in a brand new avatar.,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
Laoban so nice!!! Highly recommended taste amazing too,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"This is the worst Siam Square Mookata I've been to. Prices are higher than other branches and food quality is not good. The pepper dishes are basically soaked in a small amount of fine pepper. Look at the photo to judge for yourself. Service is also lousy when we told them our plate cannot even boil, they just say is ok and walked off. While our neighbouring tables all had boiling soup. The garlic pork... Can u even see the garlic? This is the first n last time I'll eat here. Avoid if you don't want to spoil your mood.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Nice experience.

We had a long layover at the airport and treated ourselves to dinner to celebrate the end of our travelling journey.

Staff were super friendly and helpful. The view of the waterfall area was nice to view from where we were seated.

We got 2 rounds of cocktails and the sharing. Which we would recommend for those who are hungry! Worked out well for us. A whole lobster, a roll of your choice, burger of your choice and two sides of your choice.

Lobster was grilled and was nice but slightly lacking in that fresher flavour that I’ve had other places.
They were also out of the chicken burger which we would’ve liked to try.
Other patrons were a little bit rude, two people in T-shirts and younger seemed to annoy them. But we didn’t care that much. And the staff made us feel very welcome. Maybe seating a little further apart for the bar stools

Overall a nice experience for the food and drinks if you’re looking at spending some time in the airport area.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
4/5🌟 . Restaurant runs by local Thai. The food taste good and portion are big too. It is highly recommended to try their fried mango salad. Do visit them as they are running rebates in points for customer with their membership that can be use on the next visit.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"This prata shop serves really bad coffee, makes you wait too long to be served, but the prata is really good. Ordered the Onion-egg prata and the Cheese Tissue prata and they were delicious and above average compared to other local prata stalls. Prices were average in today’s standard and when they finally show up, the staff were really nice too.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"I would say this is the best herbal soup place I have tried. You can try pig stomach soup, black chicken soup, turtle soup with yam rice. However you can bring your own whiskey or cognac to add on the soup so to make it nice ! You can keep your bottle there and hey will give you a number to remember. The restaurant is clean and food service is great. Food comes fast and aircon is cold enough for you to drink the herbal soup without sweating ! Highly recommended and I will come again..",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The restaurant is known for its authentic flavors and generous portions. The menu features a variety of dishes, from dim sum to noodles and rice dishes. The restaurant also offers a selection of vegetarian dishes. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, with a warm and friendly staff. The restaurant is also known for its reasonable prices and excellent service.good",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The sesame oil chicken (with only the wings part) cost $26, the sambal sotong size is smaller than 5cents coin size and cost $15! It’s totally not worth it.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"One of my favourite food places in Singapore! :-)

The lady boss is always so cheerful, genuine and welcoming! Great service as always, just a little sad to see the prices going up a little more each time cause of inflation… :”)

If you cook your own Okonomiyaki, you’re entitled to a 10% discount (which brings the price to $16.20++) which is nice since it’s quite a fun activity with instructions provided! I love being able to place endless amount of bonito flakes when I DIY~

The Potato Cheese Mentai is one of my favourites, though a little pricey at $12++.

The Garlic Fried Rice is not bad, but not as good as the Okonomiyaki and Potato Cheese Mentai.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
I ordered them via food panda and I received a missing product and a expired product. Literally expired product.. I ordered vadai and they sent me Chilli chicken where I'm a vegetarian and 2nd order was chapati which they sent me an expired chapati..  Literally there were fungus in my chapati ... how can they be so careless... eat at your own risk..!!!!,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE

"Updated post, 29 Apr 23
We had a home lunch party for about 11 adults (7 non veg, 4 vegetarians) Ordered for a delivery through Tandoori Corner’s website. $347 incl delivery

The food arrived on time, still warm and well packed (briyanis were in plastic bentos and ala cartes were in individual plastic containers, naan wrapped in foil)

We took some poor pictures so can only post our delivery receipt to show our satisfaction. Everyone enjoyed the hearty and tasty meal and our party was a success! Thank you Surender and Tandoori Corner!!!!

Prev post Dec 2022
Been enjoying Tandoori Corner for years… since I was an omnivore and have continued as a vegetarian. A long overdue review!

The menu is extensive, there is something for everyone.  Typically we come for dinner to enjoy the cool alfresco seating. We also used to cater with Tandoori Corner for our home parties and office functions (before covid) and everyone is happy.

But yesterday the lunch atmosphere was great too. We ordered the set lunches, generous portions for $10-12 each, add a drink for $1.

Do make a booking if coming for dinner, it can get quite packed!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"5 course dinner, best dish was the Steam Seabass/kimbalor (don't have the picture)

The rest was so so only. I felt the prawns were quite salty though.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Food and ambience is good but they are quite short of staff. Difficult to get waiters attention especially if you are sitting towards the peripheries. Additionally kitchen also forgot 3/4 of our order so we had to wait and extra 45mins for it :(,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Ordered omakase cuisine for about 90sgd per pax. Most plates were good. I only wished the mains came earlier, as it was the second last meal - we were already too full by then.

The oyster was the star of the dish.

I felt that there was no need for the fried potato ball.

The tofu egg wasn't that nice.

The chawamushi was good but it had a layer of sauce that was sweet and sour which wasn't pleasant.

The crab sauce dumplings had too thick of a skin, and the fillings were not springy enough.

The mains which were the sashimi don and fried rice wagyu beef, were delicious.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE

"Blue Lotus consistently delivers a high quality menu. The chilli pomelo crab is a must have. Do make your reservation and let them know your intention. The crabs come in fresh every late afternoon.
The outdoor seating is a must book as well, the ambience is very enjoyable.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"If you know what Dum Biryani is, then this is the best place in Singapore for that dish. Highly recommended.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Interesting concept of HK/Canto tapas. Food was good but serving size was quite small. A little too high on the price in my opinion. Drinks came in a glass filled with 80% ice, don’t know why they do that as it is only a can of Coke.",POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
A beach club which does dinner service in an air conditioned restaurant section. Spanish styled tapas and mains dominate the menu. Extensive range of drinks including cocktails and wine. Food quality really good as well as service.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Staff were friendly but like some past reviewers have experienced, they claimed that the prices on the menu were wrong when I questioned them on why some items were charged differently from what were stated. Food standard was below average.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"A non halal eatery. Have dined at marche for a good few times. All the while, they are well knowned for their rosti. Still one of the best after so many years. Crispy on the outside and soft inside. Pair well with the sour cream. Do expect to queue and wait for your turn and dish to be ready. Once you are at ordering counter..service is relatively fast. Menu clearly states what is available and TODAY'S SPECIAL. So, if you want to be served fast; think about what you want to order while in line before reaching ordering counter.

Dishes are generally made for 1 person portion. So maybe sharing is possible if you are in a group to taste relatively different food available.

Some food station practice ordering and wait for your food to be ready before collection using a buzzer such as pizza counter and pasta counter.

Dessert wise...only still can stomach in ice cream. LOVED IT!!!!!!!. very very nice, not too creamy.

Queue to be entered and served. Price wise..not the most budget friendly.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Food is amazing. The briyani is really good for the price point. Prata is crispy but not too greasy and the Maggie goreng merah was pretty good too.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

We started off w gnocchi , and liked how simple it is . This continued w portobello w chimichurri sauce . And taking taste profile higher w the chargrilled cabbage . Going to the mains, we moist our palate w Ceviche then feast on lamb Picanha . As we enjoyed, a friendly staff introduced us to organic orange wine . In between, more friends joined us and we topped up w wagyu picanha and croquetas .

It is a joyful meal, indeed . Would come back again !",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Great ambience. Food and service is great as well. Excellent blend of nature and lifestyle at the outdoor seatings. Elegant yet cozy in the indoor seatings.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Expensive food and small portion for brunch.
Drinks were pretty and tasted ok. Deco inside the cafe was beautiful.

We went with a dog and it rained really heavily.  When it was starting to rain, we asked the waitress for another place to dine, we were told there was no place we can finish our drinks inside the restaurant with a dog with us.
We tried to finish our drinks at the outdoor seats but the rain got heavy very fast.

We were only led to the patio by another waitress which is sheltered and at the side of the restaurant when my partner and I stand by the door of the restaurant due to the very heavy rain because the outdoor umbrella cannot shelter 4 people from the rain. We were drenched and standing there looking at the nice deco in the restaurant like the girl in the story of ""Little Match Girl"". Just nice that day was Christmas day.. So much feels.

Unforgettable day of brunch celebration for all the wrong reasons.

Won't return again.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Beautiful restaurant near the sea which makes you feel like you’re on a vacation away from Singapore. Service was impeccable from the moment we stepped in, and every dish was beyond our expectations. Was also surprised that the prices were not exorbitant given the quality of food, service and ambience. Already making plans for my next few reservations (good to book 1-2 months in advance to get your desired weekend dates!).",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Wait for ten minutes in the queue, when it was my turn to order, the macik asked me to wait for the chinese lady to serve me. however, the Chinese lady chose to walk away and left me standing there. I ended up walking away empty handed because they chose their customers. Not the right way in service line.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Variety of dishes in the menu, the atmosphere was good but too dim inside makes me headache. Price is average.

Spaghetti carbonara was flavorful and creamy. The mix grilled platters worth its price as there were chicken chop, pork chop, lamb chop and sausage in it. The pizza was not bad, it had cheese, tomatoes, sausages and pineapples on it.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Prata is not crispy and overall soggy and not fragrant. One of my order was missed out and they subtly replaced it with a cheaper one without informing me.,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Tried a new restaurant close-by the CBD. Had the set lunch, and the food was not bad. My favourite item was the Croûte aux Champignons 🤤

Pictured:
- Croûte aux Champignons: Wild Mushrooms Ragout on Toasted Bread
- Mignons de Porc au Poivre Noir: Pork Tenderloin, Black Pepper Sauce & Potato Rösti
- Filet de Bar, Sauce Vierge: Sea Bass Fillet, Virgin Sauce & Seasonal Vegetables
- Coupe Romanoff: Vanilla Ice-Cream, fresh Strawberry and Chantilly Cream",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"$10.80 - XO carrot cake
$12.80 - octopus karaage
$11.80 - roast pork
$12.80 - braised pork belly with preserved vegetable
$15.80 - kailan 2 ways
$2 - plain rice
$3.50 - Thai iced tea
$2.50 - oolong tea

Our total bill for this place came up to $83.38, even after a card discount that took the signature carrot cake off the bill.

This place is incredibly overpriced. The place was empty when we went and the server seems nice enough, but the food ranged from average to bad.

The carrot cake was probably the best, but was average at best, like what you would get at dimsum places... Look at the size... That's 10.80++!

Octopus karaage was not crunchy and the portion was super small, while the sauce was like mayo, worse than sweechoon's kind of trashy sauce.

The kailan was just fried with floss on top... $15.80++! Are you kidding me?

The braised pork belly had so little pork that my friend had a piece each and I only had preserved vegetable. Just look at the pork in the picture... You can barely find any. $12.80 for preserved vegetable.

The winner is the ""Thai iced tea"" as it was described in the menu. It was clearly bottled tea.

This place borders on being scammy I would not recommend at all!!",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Super happy to discover this gem of a place on a Sunday afternoon for late lunch! The ambience was awesome. It was not crowded at all which at first was slightly worrying to me, but after we tried the first dish that we ordered, the rest just kept getting better than the dish before! We had Cavatelli pasta with generous serving of squid, delicious carbonara cooked on a slab of cheese at the table, roasted octopus, and a shoulder of lamb that went excellently with toasted sourdough. The service was also fantastic, and Edward was very friendly and accommodating to our requests. It was a very satisfying and perfect slow lunch on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Will come back for sure.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"My family came to Poulet at Causeway Poulet for dinner around 7pm on the 29th of October, Sunday. The food was very delicious. Great ambience and service was outstanding. Special shout out to 2 of your staff especially Nur on being knowledgable on the menu and giving us top notched service. And Rai for being so attentive in providing us great service too. Will definitely recommend family members and friends to patronise Poulet. Kudis to Poulet for employing wonderful employees. Thanks again for giving us a wondeeful experience.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The chicken is great and the service by the male manager is amazing. Can’t say for the female manager.

Wrap the chicken with the special ginger is must do at this restaurant.

Remember to order the olive rice to pair the dishes.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"This restaurant served one of the best foods around this vicinity. The hot pot steam fish was rather tasty. The grouper first was fresh. The savoury chilli crabs were marvellous. The vegetables and boneless pork loin were tender and juicy.
Overall, we had a sumptuous dinner",POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
Amazing quality food well presented and perfect service by Emilia and Nelly. We enjoyed ourselves very much. Will definitely be back next time ;),POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

"Another normal food court but not very affordable.

Coffee no so nice.

Sugarcane juice watery.

Duck rice pricey.

Papaya salad okay.",POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
"Tried signature and is awesome for the comfort it brought . Staff are extremely friendly and accommodating . Thanks and keep it up . Space is however very tight from table to table , we have to move to another place to be able to enjoy the conversation better .",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Tapas were very unique and tasty. I believe we had the grilled octopus and some anchovy + burrata cracker. Paella was nothing exceptional. Desserts (rice pudding and orange cake) were alright. If I were to go again, I would order just the tapas.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The chilli prawn pasta was filling and tastes pretty good. The portion was quite generous and the chilli was adequately spicy.

I ordered the gula melaka latte and it tasted nothing like gula melaka. It tastes just like regular latte. Then, I had the the espresso ice cream which tastes nothing like espresso and more like milk coffee. Odd.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"It’s such beautiful that your neighbor have a Japanese food with very affordable price.
The quality was good and amount of the food also quite generous!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
"Nice place and ambience. The Staff service was very good also.

Food was good. ordered the beef sandwich but beef was quite dry. The staff offered to change the sandwich for us and we ordered the snow shell crab sandwich which was really tasty.

Just a minor feedback, we found a fish bone and some scales while eating the salmon sashimi. Not sure if that is normal for salmon sashimi. Might want to take note when ordering their salmon platter.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
First time trying squid ink ramen here and it’s interesting! Love to have the broth here on cold days.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Spacious and food was delicious.

Missed the cheechongfun timing (before 5pm?)

Anyway other dim sums were great. Siu mai, ha hao, xiao long bao were onestar Michelin worthy as expected. Juicy and filled with meat.

Food: 5/5
Price: 4/5 slightly pricey without bank promo
Vibe: 4/5",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"First visited, the ambience was a bit too dim when first walk in, my opinion slightly brighter will be good enough.

The “Tokyo Hummus” is a very good choice that the bartender recommended to me. Lucky I do not miss it. The truffle mushroom rice was a bit creamy because it came with a sizzling hot pan.

The cocktail choice is awesome, and the bartender can be based on your favour and demand to create something for you.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The food has gotten from bad to worse, and usually the safest food I’ll buy it’s either Nasi Goreng or Prata, but today Nasi Goreng is as good as eating plain rice with Anchovies with Chilli. No absolute taste at all and what surprises me is that there’s a Mee found in the noodle , which explains that the chef didn’t even bother to clean the Wok before frying the following orders!!!!! This really upsets all of us!",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
Always walked passed but never patron before. Today decided to give it a try since it always full house. Indeed it tasty & portion is reasonable. Will definitely come back to try their other dishes.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
very nice place but hars to reach with oublic transport,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"I would like to thank all the staff serving us as quickly as possible for our iftar.

The food was not delivered early before breaking of fast which is appreciated. I know that with this type of system will be bound to encounter delay on 1 or 2 dishes (which for us is the ala carte dish, Mee Hon Kong.) Nevertheless, rest of meal was nice except the Tom Yum Soup (tasted bland). Apart from it, we have a wonderful experience there.

Would recommend others to iftar there. Slightly pricey but for the service and ambience, it is well deserve.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Great food, decent priced drinks with live entertainment. Very fun environment!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Pretty expensive local fare. But to be fair, the portions are pretty big. U can probably share a plate of fried rice or hokkien Mee but i think still expensive. The food is pretty OK but I thought it's on the oily side for me. Service as usual first class",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"About $49 for a pad thai, curry noodles, 2 drinks, and a salad to share",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Ok wine, food of my companions looked sub standard (quesadillas, nachos). Only dish that people had good things to say about were the buffalo wings. Great place for watching sports though.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Well prepared service crew Ezann! Thank you for recommending us the Christmas meal-for-2; the four cheese pizza 🍕, strawberry frizz with passion fruit 😋😋 Will definitely recommend to families and friends ☃️",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Remembered this Thai restaurant has been around for a long time. Find it very interesting, because you will have to scan the menu, which will lead you to the grab platform. Find it not so user friendly. 🤔🤔 for customers who don’t have Grab app.. alittle hard to order.

The serving of the food was prompt. We prefer the clear Tom Yum Soup! 🥘 But will opt for seafood option next time. the portion for the egg omelette fried rice was superb, to feed 6 pax. We ordered the basil pork too. Not too spicy. Price I would say still okay!

Find the Thai milk tea and lemon tea alittle too diluted though. May not order their drinks next time.

Would say it is a nice Thai Zhi Char restaurant.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Had a great 1st meal here. Food was amazing. Started with the salmorego tomato soup so rich. Beef and pork pasta cannelloni was recommended and glad we ordered it. Octopus with cauliflower was very tender. Fiduea was full of umami but maybe a tad oily, still very yummy. Other reviewers said the white wine sangria as refreshing, but I personally preferred the red wine sangria. Can't go wrong with either to be honest. Will be back again, maybe try the beef Wellington.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Food is nice, we love everything we ordered. Crew was very friendly and helpful. recommend!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Chicken tikka, and mutton meals are worth trying.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"First time visiting there by chance! The reception area is good for taking Instagram pictures! Didn't have a reservation and arrived about lunch time but was greeted warmly and accommodated by the friendly staff!
While eating I noticed a pattern that is quite similar to Citrus by the pool and realized they both are the same company!
I loved the waffles and the portion of the ice cream was huge! I think the waiter gave me a different flavor instead of what I requested which I didn't even notice till my wife pointed it out! Guess I was too busy enjoying the waffle.
Their Cajun lamb chops need a slight improvement as it was a bit chewy but the flavour was good and the mashed potatoes were tasty!
For the price it's definitely worth it!
Hope to visit again soon.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Not sure why the rating quite low. Definitely  deserve higher. This is actually a hard to find very yummy old school tze char stall. Give it a try and u will know!,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Look at the ridiculous patty size!!! I feedback to the staff immediately. She just smile and walked away!!??,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Very delicious food, speedy delivery, and presentation was also good considering it came via delivery.
Samsui chicken was very tasty as usual, Ginger fried rice was fragrant and delicious, brocolli was the right texture and taste, hometown tofu was simple and soothingly tasty, sweet and sour pork was abit small but nonetheless good, longevity buns were beautiful.  Super happy on the effort taken, thank you team at IMM, a very scrumptious meal indeed.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The plain prata is among the best in town. Worth coming just for that. Mutton soup is not bad as well.
Busy but Clean at any time of the day",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Son said the kids meal - Fried chicken was very yummy! Fried squid is good too! Decent priced with a nice marina view sitting outdoors.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
I was quite surprised to find this restaurant in airport terminal 3 that served pretty good quality Indian breakfast food. My friend and I really enjoyed this healthy breakfast option over other fast food options for our food before our flight. It’s self service and price is airport price but the food is definitely worth it given we pay more for dry burgers.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Sandep was the MVP for the night. Excellent service and hospitality from him. He recomended us food that is to our liking. Thankyou! Food was good and to did not disappoint. However the prawns from the pasta was not the freshest as the entire prawns was black. Steak and  Tiramisu turned out great. Will revisit again.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
I always have the young mutton biryani here. It's perhaps the only authentic Hyderabadi biryani in Singapore that I will rate. The rest are all average.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"The restaurant just reopened a week ago and it’s our first time at the buffet. The place was quite quiet, buffet spread is limited but have ample seats. The bbq pork ribs was the best dish among all. The Malaysia lok lok section have quite a lot of selection but they didn’t have a good deep fryer where the food wasn’t fried enough. So some came out uncooked and very oily inside. Hot coffee and tea is included in the buffet. Dessert was not good… the worst would be the kueh pie tee. The look of it won’t make you wana try as the stew vege was so dry and burnt. The cups have a bad oil taste too. But we had a good table service from Mr Azman where he keep recommending us to try different food! :)",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Excelent plain pratas (one of the best in Singapore)
Best teh halia.
Good dum biryani (only every Friday)
Decent selections for mixed rice meals.
Good People too.

Been eating there almost daily since They started their shop in Toa Payoh interchange.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Had a great meal at Tambi. Arrived at the restaurant on the dot and was showed to our seats. Looks pretty intimate dining at counter seats could see the chefs at work. A bit small but I believe there are bigger tables upstairs for bigger groups.
Asked the staff for recommendations and was given a few to decide. In the end since we were here we decided to order everything that was recommended.
Began with the starters, the Yellowtail Ssam which tasted interesting cooked Indian style and was complemented with the charred pineapple. Loved the pineapple which brought sweetness to the dish. The beef tartare was my most favourite in the starters which I believe should be ordered. If not the Oxtail bone marrow Murtabak should also be on the order list because it tasted so flavorful and richness of the oxtail.
Was given 2 recommendations for mains but we initially ordered one and then finally decided to get the other. First was the prawn  Maggie goreng, filled with wokhey you can see it as the chef was cooking and very fresh and giant prawn. Then we ordered and the 2nd main came which was the Australian wagyu bulgogi roti which I would say this would probably be the star of the night. So good and all the ingredients complemented each other so well the beef could just melt in the mouth.
Dessert was the banana and coconut pie which was a tad disappointing for me. Didn't really like it and would not recommend that.
Also tried a glass of Makgeolli Oh My Gat and it was quite an interesting drink.
Overall still an enjoyable meal with some memorable dishes.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"A  beautiful riverside spot in Sentosa Cove. Perfect spot to relax and unwind, featuring a Mediterranean interior.  It’s where you can enjoy delicious Mediterranean dishes with panoramic view. All their dishes are made fresh with quality ingredients and served in a warm and casually comfortable setting.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Delicious Japanese food. Ordered a set of sashimi, bento, and a beef yuzu sauteed.

Sashimi was fresh, and almost all cuts of meat tasted rich and creamy. The swordfish was the standout fish.

The Natsu bento set came with a variety of side dishes. Tha beef yakiniku was well seasoned and well cooked, and the garlic fried rice was fragrant and not too salty.

The beef yuzu sauteed is an interesting dish to try, being served with a yuzu sorbet at the side. The beef was nicely cooked, and eaten with the yuzu sorbet creates an interesting flavour and sensation, fusing sweet, sour, and savoury, and balancing warm and cold.

Definitely coming back again for the dishes.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Good quality Japanese food. Had the hot stone beef on a lead with home made miso paste. The beef was perfectly tender. The only problem was that even with an early reservation for a business lunch, they squeezed 7 of us into a table that was clearly for 6, and one of the tables was higher than the other two.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Prawn is the medium size one and the noodles belong to the wetter side. Prawn and sotong quite fresh.

Not mind blowing but imo btr than the crowded geylang stalll.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
Nice area to walk around. There's nearby parking that at night it's quite affordable too (I think we paid 2sgd for 2 hours). Pets are welcomed and can be seen quite often in the restaurants. Prices can be steep but the food is generally worth it,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Hidden gem in Holland Village. Had the calpis sour (12) and gyudon (12). Meat was nice and had the charred taste and rice had great texture too. Ambience is very chill and quiet (Thursday 10pm) and service quality was great. Amazing experience overall and would definitely come back in the future.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Hot Dog (SGD $20) @ Brotzeit.
.
Some may not know that Brotzeit is a Singaporean brand, opening its 1st outlet in July 2006, and since then has grown to 10 outlets in 5 countries.
.
Their German Bavarian rendition has a crisp toasted sourdough bun with bready sour earthy flavour, and a long snappy juicy käsekrainer pork and cheese sausage with meaty savoury spice cheesy salty flavour.
.
A light pickled gherkin relish with vegetal sour sweet flavour, creamy mayonnaise with milky sweet notes, and crispy fried shallots with vegetal earthy salty sweet flavour, complete this.

Sliced red chili lend an Asian twist and a mild spicy kick.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

"This old school restaurant brings you back to your childhood with heartwarming dishes like promfet fish, braised goose and ginkgo yam paste. Service staff were friendly and food was served piping hot and fast. Great for 3 generation meal gatherings.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Excellent place for their vege dish. Our fav dishes have always been their crispy lotus and long beans plus the long beans fried with hae bee! Today we ordered the herbal chicken and the meat was tender and juicy! Of course the lady who tooked our order is always polite and provides good service even when she has many orders at hand.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
I've eaten here many times for lunch and dinner. The food here is delicious and the portion size is generous. The prices are reasonable. The service standard here is also very good. The banchan dishes are all very good.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
"Hellishly hot place to have lunch, but my colleagues and I drive over every day for lunch like a ritual for 4 days out of 5. Food is really good, the basics like horfun, fried rice, fish soup etc are very well done with great portions and meat/veg. Meat dishes like salted egg chicken can be rather pricey unfortunately. $5/pax gets you more decent portions than the nearby market can. Service is good.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Shiity place briyani at $7.50 without egg nor the crispy thing.,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
Love the fresh yummy sashimi that are carefully put together. Love the flavours in each dish. It was so filling and yummy. A good and reasonable price omakase dinner. Would recommend.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
"I am extremely disappointed with the restaurant's decision to change the price of their Paper Tosai. It has become absolutely ridiculous and unjustifiable.

As a result, I will not be returning to this establishment anymore. The inflated prices have completely tarnished my dining experience. I urge others to be cautious before dining here, as the value for money is simply not worth it.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
"The food is average; the double-boiled watermelon soup is well well-created. Traditional Stir Fried Mee Sua is too oily but tastes good. The steamed flounder was a significant letdown; it is tasteless - even the soy sauce is without taste (I believe it could be they took a frozen piece of fish and started steaming, causing this to happen). The decoration is unique and well-created; however, the restaurant is like a marketplace; if you want to enjoy your dinner in peace, avoid this place. They were banging their bowls and plates just next table, which we had to bear constantly.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"we decided to try this Korean restaurant! the staff were nice and friendly, and the servings were HUGE! we had the teriyaki chicken bowl, which unfortunately did not have a lot of chicken. on the positive side, they gave a large amount of fresh lettuce with a drizzle of kewpie mayonnaise, and added some krispy treats on the side to give the meal a perfect texture! the kimchi on the side was fresh as well, and the soup was delish. the side of fried chicken was perfectly crispy and juicy too. we would definitely come back to try more food!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Thank you for making my first omakase experience at your restaurant so special! It was a belated birthday celebration with my best friend, and the entire afternoon was truly memorable.

The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. When I realized I couldn't eat the beef in the ""SO BBQ"" dish (the description only mentioned hanging tenderloin), they quickly offered a delicious fish alternative without any hesitation. I truly appreciate their understanding and willingness to ensure I had a wonderful dining experience. Perhaps adding small icons to the menu indicating the type of meat in each dish would be helpful for future diners, especially those with allergies or preferences. For non-Korean speakers, adding translations or clearer description could improve understanding.

The food was fantastic overall, with a variety of creative and flavourful dishes. The sauces were flavorful, but perhaps a touch too strong for some of the dishes, slightly masking the delicate taste of the main ingredient. I also absolutely loved their kombucha and hope they consider selling it in batches in the future!

Overall, I had a fantastic experience at your restaurant and would highly recommend it to others. The staff's attentiveness, the delicious food, and the unique omakase format combined for a truly memorable experience. Thank you once again!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

My first time there and the first impression on the food taste was exceptional good and couple with good view on a jetty",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
"Went to this place for buffet lunch.Its close to Tanjong Pagar MRT, exit A in Icon Village.

The north Indian styled food tasted nice (I just had veg dishes) with one veg and one non veg starter,jeera rice,daal,naan,two veg sabji (palak panner and Gobi masala) ,two non veg curry ( chicken and mutton) ,salad and sweet dish (Rasgulla). Loved the veg pakoras :)

It has a nice sitting space.
Only con I felt that,they should refill the empty dishes fast.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"This feedback is especially only for Kailash Parbat Changi and I am a regular customer at KP Little India. I visited around 8.15 PM along with my friends family for Dinner for my daughter's birthday and we were total 13 pax. First of all, as usual food was amazing except MINI NAAN BOMB(it was in expired state which was shocking and unexpected for us but we just thought like it can happen sometime).. Now reason for giving 1 star for service, the service was extremely slow and no one was bothered to check back, we were keep calling them for the orders but it was very careless response always.. When we were placing one final order around 9.10 PM, person taking order immediately said as ""no more roti's(breads)"" is possible as we are closing now. Why I am surprised is because she didn't even listen as what I am about to order so it was very bad experience and I believe Kailash Parbat at Changi is good only for Buffets and not for Ala Carte as staff are very lazy and bit rude.. One last thing is our bill was 250+ so we were been informed that we can go for some complimentary or discount of 5% on bill but we were done with our food so we opted for discount which was not applied during payment and when I called & checked back with restaurant, response is that its customer's responsibility to inform during payment at counter as we cannot check with each customer during payment, its funny again as response was bit hard to listen. So guys plan accordingly at this outlet specifically  when planning for Ala Carte so that you don't get face disappointment.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"One of my favourite restaurant in Woodlands

Ordered
Mushroom soup

The hot chocolate lava goes well with ice cream

Felt that they lack of respect for customers.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Teh Halia is excellent. Good balance of ginger jus and teh. A little frothy would have completed the experience. 5*

Fritter was cold. Decent in taste but I reckon it would be excellent if it was at least warm. 4*

Maggi Mee Goreng was flavorful and came with 2 small pieces of fried chicken which were average. 3.5*

Kway Teow Kuah was very much a disaster. Kway Teow was not blanched through resulting it stiffed. The kuah was good. With only a few strands of cabbage and an egg, there was nothing else. No bits of protein nor pea. Come on, for the price! 2*

Service is prompt. Upon ordering from server, the food will be served to your table.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Best dining experience I had in Singapore and I live here for over 10 years. Relaxed atmosphere, wine pairing is only an option (not a must!), food is absolutely delicious, great fusion of best quality meats and seafood. Strong flavors which paired so well, unbelievable. I am European so I do pay attention to my sourdough, I haven’t tried something like this in my life. These are really passionate people cooking in front of you; just watch, enjoy, relax and admire!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
The Hainan pork chop is good. The rest of the dish is decent very average taste. Today with only 2 of us. we order a fish which is quite big and they recommended us to try pork knuckle with sea cucumber which is huge. There is no way 2 person can finish the pork knuckle let along we have other dish. There is 2 small piece of sea cucumbers in there to show.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

"First time dining here since they moved.  Staff are friendly enough, and the restaurant serves several sets for lunch, including Thai chicken with rice, and fried pork with rice.  There are also ala carte dishes like sambal kang kong and sotong, as well as otah.

Our Thai chicken and fried pork sets were okay, and the sunny side up eggs were freshly cooked and delish.  The rice was a large portion, but the meat was not.  We also ordered an ice lemon tea and lime juice.  Lunch overall was $19.90, which was slightly on the high side.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Love the ambience, service and food here. The enchanting entrance will sure catch your attention while you walk past it! Staff was really friendly and attentive.

Highly recommend the Sea Urchin rolled with Kagoshima A4 Wagyu Beef, Beluga Caviar.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Portion of main was big. Ordered the Hawaiian teriyaki chicken chop. The marinade was abit on the sweet side, and too sweet for me.

Ordered a main and their promotion of a dozen of $1 oysters. Was a steal!

Was a hearty meal. Good enough for 2 ladies to share.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Great Japanese restaurant.
Service was good. The staff was polite and was prompt to guide us to our seats.
Food was priced reasonable.
Quite like the food here and was a great dining experience.

"Been to Charlie's Restaurant on a weekend afternoon at Boat Quay to have lunch recently. Got a seat along the Singapore River and the view was perfect to enjoy on a breezy afternoon. Ordered the Charlie's burger which was one of their signature item on the menu, it was great! A whiff of it got my mouth watering.. The quality of the ingredients and texture of the meat are spectacular, patty was juicy which I personally enjoy very much. Service staffs were also friendly, ensured that guests are well taken care of at the restaurant. Definitely worth a return to try other food on their menu!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Nice place to have brewed beer. Until 3pm the beer cost is 3 Sgd fir one pint value for money

"Went for the buffet on a weekday evening.

This is our 3rd time eating. And each time the food standard has changed and dropped. Now for 45++ for dinner, it is quite a steep price. But u do get a good variety of food. Some hits some misses.

The abacus used to be awesome, but the last 2 visits were disappointing. The roast and bbq pork was good, standards maintained. Drunken prawns  good too. Chilli crab, lacked flavour but the crab quality was solid n meaty. Buddha jump over the wall was decent, with an abalone, black chicken, mushroom some cordecyp flowers and a tiny dried scallop. The kailan was quite salty. Spinach 3 egg was average. Orh nee dessert good altho i didn't fancy the coconut cream. Mango sago normal.

Staff was friendly and thoughtful. But then again we were the ONLY table that evening.

The buffet is a good option to try various options. Portions are standard zichar sizes and not small plates so if u go eat in a small group, you may not be able to try many dishes cos you'll be full early on.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
One of my family's favorite eating place. We have always enjoyed the food and it can have an extra serving of the soup. Yummy and comfort food,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

"Came here on July 18th, 2023. Located at the other end of Zhongshan Mall, near Ramada Hotel (currently closed) and facing Zhongshan Park. Quite a cool place with comfortable seating. Had the Paneer Salad, Mutton Vindaloo and Naan bread, all of which were really tasty and accompanied my beers very well. I was only surprised to hear English music when I walked in as I was hoping for some Indian tunes, only later to realize that they mix the playlist with English and Tamil songs. Nevertheless, service was great also.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
Don’t waste your money and time here. I tried it once and will never come back here. The food is not cheap either.,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"My favorite dish here is the Basil Chicken Rice. Hands down the best I’ve had in Singapore.

The Thai style Kang Kong was kinda weird. It tastes like vegetables cooked in curry sauce.",POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE
"Mixed Experience (Visit Date 26 Jun 22)

It was great that:
1.Not crowded when we went at 6pm and got a cosy corner seat
2. Friendly servers
3. Casual environment
4. The food came fast
5. Quesadilla, Samosa, Aglio Olio were good

Disappointing:
1. Ordered sweet potato fries.  Got us  regular fries. They took it back. A gentleman came back to say they didn't have sweet potato. So we asked to give us regular ones. Then someone got us some soggy ones. The same ones they made by mistake for us earlier?
2. The lady seemed to get things a little mixed up. Messed up the fries and then just forgot we had ordered quesadillas.
3. Prices (of drinks that we got) at par or more than FOC Sentosa or Coastes. View, Ambience and Service do not match",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"Great food with friendly crews!!!! The lighting in d restaurant is something new to me. They have both bright and romantic(cosy ) dining areas for us to choose
.. Food with reasonably pricing... The nice to meet u platter is cool",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Convenient location. Food and service are average, but too expensive.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Good variety of dim sum.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Food was a littleeee salty like those you would find in Bangkok but nothing to really complain about. Just ask for less salty if you prefer it that way. The service was impeccable! They were more than happy to answer our questions and were very friendly.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Very prompt service, comfortable place for both casual or formal tasty meals. Samsui Chicken with ginger sauce & lettuce is always so refreshing. Staff were very pleasant too!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
Music is a bit loud but food is good.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"My private family’s lunch at this Michelin star restaurant was exceptional. The chef's creativity shone through in the dishes, which were full of flavor and presented beautifully. The service was attentive and professional, making the dining experience even more enjoyable. The atmosphere was private and stylish, with pleasant decorations and a perfect setting for dining. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys fine dining.$$$$",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Samurai chicken burger was nice especially the sauce! The green tea ice cream was okay only, it's not matcha, but green tea. The seaweed fries were very flavourful too.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Ordered veg and got non-veg. Tried calling almost a dozen times and then drove back all the way to the restaurant, instead of accepting the mistake, they were arguing but finally accepted the mistake and replaced with the veg dish. Overall quality of food has dramatically gone down. Overall very poor experience - both with the food and with how we were dealt with. Used to be our regular haunt for good north Indian food but don't think we will go there again.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
"The quality of the food we had, particularly the pork, was absolutely exceptional. The succulent and flavorful taste of the grilled meat left us craving for more. It was evident that great care had been taken in sourcing high-quality ingredients and ensuring their preparation was done with expertise. The combination of flavors and the overall taste surpassed our expectations. Thank you!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE

Restaurant Manager, Emil is very friendly and hospitable. Their staffs asked whether we need glasses for our Whiskies and offered to wash our Glasses when we are done.

They allow us to Bring Whisky Bottle and it’s CORKAGE FREE!",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,POSITIVE
"Kaisendon options are good value and tasty. They also served a free bowl of miso soup, appetiser (carrot, daikon, and some bits of fish), and cold tea, which is nice. Unfortunately, the beef tataki was quite disappointing. It had a texture that was somewhat off and didn't quite taste like beef. No sear and was cooked more done than it should be. It might be that we were unlucky and got a bad piece because we saw others which looked much better.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE
My daughter is obsessed with their pratas. It is our go to joint. Staff are super warm and friendly. Great and fast service.,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE
