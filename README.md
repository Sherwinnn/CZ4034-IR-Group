## Project Description:
With the plethora of restaurant options available in Singapore, we aim to build a search engine that helps users retrieve the most relevant restaurants according to their needs. Users can also enhance their search through the different filters and sorts available. Additionally, we conduct sentiment analysis on the crawled reviews to gain interesting insights into the restaurants.
