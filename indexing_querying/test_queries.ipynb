      "Restaurant: Marché Mövenpick VivoCity, Review: We went to Marche Movenpick at Vivo City over the weeekend. The restaurant is spacious and has a great atmosphere. Moreover, it's a kid-friendly restaurant, making it an ideal spot for family outings. Our personal favorites from the menu were the Rosti with sausages and Chicken Schnitzel. The rosti was cooked to perfection, with a delightful combination of crispy and tender textures. The Chicken Schnitzel, too, was crispy and tasty that left us craving for more. While the Aglio Olio we ordered had a fantastic texture, it leaned a bit towards the salty side, which was our only minor concern. However, this didn't overshadow the overall wonderful experience we had at Marche. We are looking forward to returning to Marche soon to explore more of their menu., qualityScore: 0.2072973090448465\n",

      "Restaurant: Greenwood Fish Market, Review: Visiting this Sentosa Cove restaurant posed a challenge due to the absence of public transportation. Despite an unexpected weekend crowd, the restaurant's mixed indoor-outdoor setup had both positive and negative aspects. The outdoor fan's overwhelming strength led us to ask the staff for adjustment, and they were accommodating, agreeing to 'slow down' its intensity. While some dishes, like the seafood platter, lived up to expectations, the Prawn Aglio Olio disappointed with noticeably small and less-than-fresh prawns. Furthermore, the calamari wasn't served at the desired temperature. The outdoor atmosphere, combined with its proximity to the sea, attracted numerous flies, significantly affecting the overall dining experience., qualityScore: 0.1634712307275162\n",

It feels meticulous and passionate, and this are the qualities I really appreciate when it comes to dining.\\n\\nThe omakase here features curated dishes that tends towards the traditional type, with some rare features and also omakase premium regulars such as hirame, kinmedai, akami, and of course, chutoro, otoro plus lots of sweet uni! I'm definitely very happy to savour these fishes, especially the trinity, because they are so flavourful and delicious. The thing that makes the meal memorable and unique is the additional refreshing flavours packed into each dish. It feels like beloved traditional taste being made exciting and surprising. I love it.\\n\\nAnd get your cameras ready because the place is so instagram-worthy. Designed by renowned architect Kengo Kuma, every corner of the restaurant radiates that air of quiet tranquility of Japanese bamboo forest while having that classy modern feel. I can use the whole day to watch the water flowing out of the bamboo spout and into the water fountain made from a boulder from Japan because it is so relaxing. The counter, designed for six to seven diners, is made from 150 year-old hinoki wood. With all these elements, I feel really special dining here.\\n\\nThe service is impeccable, outstanding and professional. And yes, very thoughtful, this is the epitome of Japanese hospitality. Thanks to Miura san and team for the awesome time.\\n\\nSaba with nori is so good. The sweetness of saba is accentuated by the vegetal pungency of ginger flower, shiso leaf and chive.\\n\\nChawamushi here is one of the most unique and delicious because the cauliflower puree and tofu skin added make the silky egg custard lighter, cleaner in taste and sweeter. There is so much creamy sweet uni that I can have a piece to go with each mouthful of the custard.\\n\\nMiyazaki Beef prepared in mille feuille form packs all the melty fats to yield this meaty treat that feels very creamy on the palates. I love it.\\n\\nIshida is a rarity in Japanese omakase, so I'm definitely happy to try it. When I bite into this morsel of delight, I feel that distinctive contrast between the warmth of shari (rice) and coolness of neta (topping), and I love it. Very well-executed.\\n\\nLightly seared on the surface, the Nodoguro sushi is one of my favourites here. It is so creamy and buttery, carrying a briny sweetness accentuated by the taste of char.\\n\\nNegitoro and Bafun Uni Temaki is overflowing with the fresh uni! It is so good!

Service was bad, food was mediocre, and prices are quite ridiculous. No one working here seems to know how an f&b business functions.\\n\\nArrived around 5.45pm on a Sunday evening to avoid the crowd, and we wanted to sit away from the sun shining in. The lady server simply said (with a pitiful face) that they were short staffed, and we couldn't take the sit we wanted (restaurant was about 40% full then). We took another table, but the seats we initially wanted were filled up shortly in the next 15mins.\\n\\nThen she walked over and told us the sun will go away eventually, which was honestly a little unnecessary a statement. Obviously the sun setting, will eventually go away. But when it's shining in your face, it is and will be an issue, for as long as the sun is still up.

It was honestly not possible for someone to wait for the table to have all their food, before we started eating.\\n\\nService staff didn't want to look up, nor react to our requests, but just to get dishes from kitchen to table, kitchen to table. I ended up having to walk towards the kitchen numerous times, stood there, and still, they ignored my presence. Store manager was just apologizing to every single table (I kid you not, every...), which baffles me why they're not solving a systemic challenge.\\n\\nTaste of the food was mediocre to say the least. But taste aside, I was more concerned with the price point. I understand that meat is expensive, and rentals are expensive. But to pay close to $40 for my meal, at the mediocre quality, is definitely a huge mismatch in price-to-value.\\n\\nAlso, the ventilation is quite bad - my clothes were reeking of deep fried oil, after exiting the place.

Service was also very fast.\\n\\nGot ourselves the sambal kangkong, hotplate tofu, cereal chicken, and their fish and mushroom soup.\\n\\nThe only unfortunate downside is how the hygiene levels behind the scenes, feels like we were in a roadside stall in JB.
