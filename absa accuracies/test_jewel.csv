296,NAEUM Restaurant,5,"Today, we dined at NAE:UM and ordered the classic menu of Episode 5 with both half wine pairing and non-alcoholic pairing. I must say that everything from the service, taste, to presentation was impeccable. My favorite dish of the night was the BBQ beef dish, which was extremely juicy and flavorful. It is probably one of the best beef dishes I have had in Singapore.

What impressed me the most was the amount of thought put into pairing each drink with each dish. The pairings complemented each other perfectly. One of the staff members highly praised one of the pairing wine, Joseph Faively, and that it is his favorite wine, and I could very much see why it was his favorite.

As a cherry on top, the staff left us alone after serving us the celebration cake, which was a great touch as my companion and I enjoyed being able to enjoy our own space. The only criticism we have is that the sparkling Jasmine tea was a bit rough on the throat and not to my taste.

Overall, I came in with high expectations for NAE:UM and left very impressed with the experience.","Today, we dined at NAE:UM and ordered the classic menu of Episode 5 with both half wine pairing and non-alcoholic pairing.

717,Fu Lin Men Chinese Restaurant (National Service Resort & Country Club),1,"Most horrible experience ever. Made a reservation on Quandoo, went down and they told me Quandoo made a mistake because they are fully booked. Our booking was for 7pm and we arrived at 655pm. There were 3 big tables empty at that time. Told me it was for 730pm reservation. If they had let me in at 7pm, some other tables would have been done at 730pm. A family came in later than 730pm and apparently knows the manager. Manager ushered them to the empty at the front. They seemed to dislike the table or for some other reason wanted to change their table. Manager moved them to another empty table inside and suddenly we now have a table. What kind of reason could it be that when a family switched seat there was suddenly an available table? It means that there was a table available all this time? And they waited 45 min to give us a table?

So we finally sat down and ready to place our orders. Waited 15 min to have our orders taken by apparently only the managers can take order. But at this point all the managers suddenly disappeared.

There were flies flying around and I even killed one on the menu. We saw someone‚Äôs Peking duck getting served and they dropped the cracker on the table. The waitress picked it up with his bare hands and put it back on the plate. That was when we know we had to get out of there. We waited 45 min for a table despite having a reservation, 15 min just to have someone come to us to take order. 1 hour for nothing.

Overall a very bad experience and will never be back without even trying their food. They blamed the app but it is on the restaurant to at least have the courtesy to call the patrons and let them know? It is Mother‚Äôs Day and everywhere else is fully booked. Where do they expect us to get a table?","Most horrible experience ever. Made a reservation on Quandoo, went down and they told me Quandoo made a mistake because they are fully booked.

This was a busy evening at the Silver Shell Cafe. When we made the booking about 6 hours earlier, the restaurant reservation concierge was not sure if we could be seated inside. A month earlier we had a quiet dinner at the same pace but it was so warm and sultry, I did not enjoy either the ambience or the food.

Today we had opted for their buffet sitting inside and it was wonderful!
We were served by the same Thai lady who had served us a month earlier. She was very attentive and accommodating.

The Sunday theme was ""Singapore good Ol' Days"" and Boy! Was that Good!. The spread was exhaustive!
There was a salad bar, cheese, bread and charcuterie, a small spread of sushi, seafood station with clams, scallops, prawns and mussels.
At the Indian counter there was a delicious tandoori fish  along with a reasonable spread of veg and non veg options.
In the live satay station, beef and lamb satay were the best. There was a spicy sambal prawn to die for. The roasted lamb was ok. They also served a coconut chicken ( don't remember the name) which was the tastiest with rainbow coloured rice.
On another end of the hall was roasted duck, char siew, olive rice, chilli crabs and many others.I cannot even name all.
The dessert bar was quite exhaustive too. The bread pudding was very good and so was the creme brulee. The gula melaka sago was a little bland in comparison to others. There were assorted tarts cakes and fruits. The  pandan kaya and lapis cake were very good
We had shiraz to go with it all. Wine by the glass was quite comparable price-wise to any other city restaurant.
Delicious food in a great ambience. it was priceless family time.","Visit Date: 19 Nov 23

694,Brotzeit German Beer Bar and Restaurant - VivoCity,2,"Decent German fare, shambolic service.
Ordered a pretzel, Salmon rosti and water. Both dishes tasted decent and were served quickly.
Unfortunately, water wasn't served till it was time for payment. By then had I finished my meal. There wasn't a word of apology or a hint of remorse for this regrettable service hiccup.  Say less about needing to pay an additional dollar for the glass of ""refillable"" water that I eventually left without having a sip of.
I  requested to be seated away from the smoking area and was met with a rude response from the server. The lack of proactiveness to help move my plates over sums up the disaster-class from the restaurant,  leaving me to move the plates by myself.

An upsetting experience that I will actively avoid in future.","Decent German fare, shambolic service.

319,White Restaurant (Tampines Mall),4,"Relatively new kid on the block. Decided to give it a try and I think one of the bosses was very friendly and courteous to the diners and was really making sure the diners enjoyed the food.
Quite crowded on a weekend morning even when it just opened for the day. Ordered the small prawn noodles, big prawn noodles and the big prawns zuke. Also had the prawn roll and the fried tofu.
The starters selection was very limited to only 4 items, would hope they can expand the selection someday. The mains serving was quite generous, and also like many have mentioned it's more on the expensive side. The broth is different from the prawn noodles and the prawn zuke, the prawn noodles broth had the pork ribs flavour as well while the prawn zuke was purely prawn broth which I enjoyed more. The serving for the broth in the little teapot was not a lot, and the staff came to give me another refill which was then just sufficient for the dish. Was a wise move using short rice also, making the dish very tasty.
I personally liked the fried tofu but the prawn roll was nothing to shout about. I guess the portion is quite big so I don't see people ordering loklok.
Good broth and good experience.","Relatively new kid on the block. Decided to give it a try and I think one of the bosses was very friendly and courteous to the diners and was really making sure the diners enjoyed the food.
