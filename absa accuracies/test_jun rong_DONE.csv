893,Tapas Club,4,"A Mixed Experience at Tapas Club: Delectable Cuisine with Premium Pricing.

My visit to Tapas Club offered a culinary journey through their menu of Spanish delicacies. The Seafood and Chicken Paella impressed with its moist rice, each grain infused with the rich essence of the ocean. Equally noteworthy were the Pulled Pork Tacos, featuring meat so tender it melted in the mouth, and the Mediterranean Salad, which was a beacon of freshness.

However, despite the high-quality food, the prices at Tapas Club are on the higher end. The cost is a significant factor to consider, especially when comparable Spanish cuisine might be found elsewhere at a more affordable rate.

Given the sparse customer turnout during a weekday lunch, it does raise the question of whether Tapas Club might review their pricing strategy to enhance their appeal, especially if they wish to draw a larger crowd during typically slower business hours.","A Mixed Experience at Tapas Club: Delectable Cuisine with Premium Pricing.

880,Mamma Mia Trattoria E Caffè (Jurong Point),5,"Had early dinner around 530pm on a weekday. The ambience and setting of this outlet is really nice and spacious. The booth seatings in the middle of the restaurant are very cozy and the way it’s designed, it still gives you privacy between tables.

Food is good, consistent across the various outlets I’ve been too. Mamma Mia is really a place you can keep coming back to again and again with friends and family to try different menu items and be assured the taste and quality will not disappoint every time.

They launched a new set menu! Limited options but a pretty good start. Extra compliments for the lemon parsley risotto I had today. Butter had a hazelnut flavour and the rice was creamy and refreshing at the same time. Very well prepared by the Chef.","Had early dinner around 530pm on a weekday.

Celebrated my mum’s 94th birthday here. 12 of us. Preordered suckling pig and the birthday buns.

Ordered 8 dishes : 7 dishes + 1 dessert.
The suckling pig is excellent.
Fried mian xian, yam ring and roast chicken also good.
The fried watercress, 大菜 the dessert yam paste orh nee soso.

Date of visit : Sat 21 Jan 2023
Time : 6 pm

Came here again to celebrate CNY. Restaurant’s really packed to the brim, people in joyous mood.

We ordered the $738+ menu. Started with lohei as usual. The 2nd dish fish maw soup came a bit late, about 30 mins later. So everything else was being delayed.

Also a bit disorganized as tables were not grouped by type of chosen menu, so staff at times didn’t know which table to serve.

Clearly not enough manpower and staff was busy.

Roast chicken was good. Braised mushroom with spinach too and the red bean sesame ball dessert.
Steamed grouper was soso.

Date of visit : Sun 30 Oct 2022
Time : 12.45 pm

Reserved a table for 12 in advance as my mum wanted to celebrate her 93th birthday here. The whole place seemed full.

Called ahead also to order a big pomfret about 1 kg+ and also the longevity buns - a pack of 18 costing about $40.

The longevity buns look beautiful. We are reminded not to consume the big bun nor the small teeny weeny apple like decoration buns.

Service is good : some dishes are divided into equal portions for us.

The Teochew style steamed pomfret lacks the same flavor as other Teochew restaurants. The deep fried oyster omelette is so thin and crispy that it’s unlike those sold at hawker centres.

A traditional restaurant with her loyal customers and above average food standards.","Date of visit : Sun 19 Nov 2023

Before i start my meal,  the cutlery are not cleaned too cos the stain still can be seen,  quite disappointed overall.","Went there for family gathering but I guess they are overwhelmed thus service & food wise not really up to standard.

677,Genki Sushi Junction 8,4,"On my visit this time around, I spent around $80 for 2 pax which is quite pricey in my opinion, but we managed to sample a variety of dishes. My craving for Japanese cuisine led me back to this familiar location, as I've had decent experiences with this sushi chain in the past. This time, however, my dining experience was satisfactory but not exceptional. The food was decent, and the service was average, although one staff member appeared visibly discontent.

As usual I'd order their salmon belly sashimi which is acceptable, 3/5, and their salmon sashimi which was disappointing,1/5. Both the sashimi dishes were not fresh at all, and they were poorly sliced. The only difference was that the salmon belly sashimi came in thicker slices compared to the regular salmon sashimi.

Their Chuka Idako, seasoned baby octpopus, were a little too big for my liking. The takoyaki was also quite poorly made. They were a little overcooked on the outside, tasted dry on the inside, and they did not give it enough toppings. Their fried squid tentacles were also a little too salty in my opinion. I also ordered their scallop sushi which was quite tasteless and not worth the price. I tried their promotional dish, the snow crab leg sushi, and it was also not worth it. The crab leg was too tiny. Another promotional dish I tried was the crab chawanmushi and it was the best dish out for all.

Overall, my dining experience here so far has been alright. For the quality, I'd say this place is a little overpriced. While dining here is acceptable, don't expect top quality food or service.

Edit 24/12/23:
I ordered food delivery from here via Grabfood. I had their salmon sashimi, salmon belly sashimi and hotate sashimi. Surprisingly this time round the Sashimi was better compared to when I dined in. The quality was better, it tasted fresher and the cuts were better sliced. I also ordered some variety of sushi and all were decent. What surprised me the most was the delivery time. It was delivered 10mins faster than Grab's prediction despite me ordering slightly past lunch time.","On my visit this time around, I spent around $80 for 2 pax which is quite pricey in my opinion, but we managed to sample a variety of dishes.

With those 2 times, only saw him interact nicely to a family that ordered wine. But I was sure both times I did not spend below 110.

Unpleasant with just that 1 staff member causing me to not be visiting again.","The meal has always been good.
