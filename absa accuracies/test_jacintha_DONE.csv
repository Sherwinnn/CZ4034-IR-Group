825,Gaig Singapore,4,"Purveyor of high-end Catalan cuisine. The offered tasting menu purports to be an overview of the restaurant's offerings, but has some notable misses. Service is attentive, though slightly pushy, while ambience is excellent on a quiet midweek night. In all, given the variable quality of the tasting menu, I would probably recommend going for ala carte versions of dishes you are actually interested in eating.

Liked:
- Galician octopus and pork belly. Honestly the best thing we had, and is unfortunately not included in the tasting menu. I think it should be - it's an excellent and easily-portioned showcase.

- Of the tasting menu:
- Amuse bouche was suitably amusing: a shot of unseasoned yet highly fragrant mushroom stock.
- Salmorejo soup with jamon ice cream was an interesting starter, though I couldn't really taste the jamon in the ice cream.
- Of the tapas courses, the croquette and bomba were standouts, especially the surprisingly spicy and piquant sauce underlying the latter.
- Stuffed Cannelloni. The presentation (a single sad-looking cannelloni spooned over haphazardly with a thick sauce) is unappetizing, but it tastes pretty good.
- Catalan creme brulee was excellent and a satisfying end to the dinner, as were the petit fours served after as a nice gesture commemorate our special occasion.

Ambivalent:
- Of the tapas courses, the toast-based tapas (the jamon and the anchovies) had toast that was a bit too crispy - when you bite into it, the toast breaks up and gets all over the table. In the case of the jamon, because of the way the jamon is shingled, it's all too easy to end up eating a whole piece of ham with your bite of toast, so that you're left with excess toast and no ham at the end. Basically the mechanics of those dishes doesn't quite work.
- Seafood Fideuà from the tasting menu. Carabinero prawn wasn't the freshest, and the short-cut noodles themselves had a sort of rubbery overfried texture while not being as flavorful as they looked.
- Crispy suckling pig with strawberries from the tasting menu. The suckling pig is good, if normal, but the presence of fresh strawberries strikes me as odd. Thought it would be good as a compote or something.

Disliked:
- Apple and Fennel salad, separately ordered. Honestly very meh; the one-note vegetal quality of the fennel overpowers the dish, burying the taste of the apple. A dish that doesn't really come together.","Purveyor of high-end Catalan cuisine. The offered tasting menu purports to be an overview of the restaurant's offerings, but has some notable misses.

210,Dungeon by IL Fiore,5,"My first time here in this quaint ""underground"" bar with a regular. My expectations were low, but were blown past sky high. I was thinking I was stepping into an Italian restaurant, as the name would suggest, but was told to try the local food. With major skepticisms, I succumbed, but was very well impressed.

(My photos will not do this place justice)

Pork Knuckle Bee Hoon - very fragrantly stir fried beehoon made this simple sounding dish very complex and flavorful

Special Oyakodon - Non traditional way of preparing oyakodon, but also very flavorful and appetising

Spam fries (not pictured) - ""that's how you prepare spam fries"".

Enough said. will be back for more","My first time here in this quaint ""underground"" bar with a regular. My expectations were low, but were blown past sky high.

551,Cheese Story Mookata Buffet,1,"I usually eat at this restaurant mostly night times around 2 or 3 am. This time when I arrive around 2am the Chinese lady came out and said they packed already and closed which is obviously she don’t wanna accept me and my friend so I asked isn’t close at 4am and she said no, we packed and close now. I was so mad didn’t say anything to her and I just left. Won’t come again since I feel like her attitude was bad. Thanks ☺️","I usually eat at this restaurant mostly night times around 2 or 3 am.

78,COLLIN'S® Jurong Point,3,"Variety of dishes in the menu, the atmosphere was good but too dim inside makes me headache. Price is average.

Spaghetti carbonara was flavorful and creamy. The mix grilled platters worth its price as there were chicken chop, pork chop, lamb chop and sausage in it. The pizza was not bad, it had cheese, tomatoes, sausages and pineapples on it.","Variety of dishes in the menu, the atmosphere was good but too dim inside makes me headache. Price is average.

428,Pixy Restaurant & Bar,4,"This was my first time at Pixy Restaurant.

The food were all made from the freshest ingredients, with seasonal flavours. The chef (boss) is extremely friendly, and the sole waitress complemented him very well, as a dynamic duo.

The Sakoshi Bay Oysters were extremely fresh and the Sashimi Carpaccio was immaculately grilled on the outside, while  juicy and tender inside.

Their Kagoshima Wagyu Beef A5 steak was accompanied by an exciting array of vegetables and sides.

Its Japanese Carbonara was very creamy and rich, and it contains top grade bacon.

A very good dining experience, and I look forward to return there.

30,White Restaurant (Tampines Mall),4,Went during lunch hour and ordered famous white beehoon and silver fish spinach soup. Beehoon is delicious and rich in gravy. Spinach soup is a total disappointment. It taste like salt water instead of the broth soup.  Spinach is old and hard to chew. Will not recommend the soup at all. Price is reasonable at $8.50 for a plate of beehoon and $6.50 for the spinach soup. No GST or Service charge. Will recommend to packet instead of dining in as the bad ventilation in the express restaurant will makes you smell bad after leaving the place.,Went during lunch hour and ordered famous white beehoon and silver fish spinach soup.

754,Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ,3,"Food quality is decent. However service here is inadequate especially if you arrive around 5 pm when the change of service staff is ongoing. Then the whole restaurant is served by 3 staff! Literally you would be ignored by the staff if you wave at them.

Even in the US store in Chicago, the staff member lowers their body to take orders just like in Japan which is a form of courtesy towards customers. In Singapore, there’s no such service and I don’t expect it. I just expect the staff not to ignore me when they obviously saw me.","Food quality is decent.

The Tom yum soup is not too spicy. The fish and seafood is fresh and nice. The manage salad is appetising. Peanuts and mango are crunchy. The prawn cake has a sweet sauce to go with.
