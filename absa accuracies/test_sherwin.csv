328,New Mahamoodiya Restaurant,5,"My go-to place for delicious crispy prata!

Their Coin Prata was well fried with a good amount of crisp. I usually go for the mutton option but decided to try the chicken which was equally good, although much lesser meat.

The Masala Dosa was served with a generous amount of aloo potato and went really well with the sauces - well worth the $3.50.

I always order my favourite egg onion prata and to my pleasant surprise the egg yolk came slightly runny today! Damn good I hope they make it like this every time. The fish curry and sambal are good as usual.

450,Yoshinoya - Junction 8,3,"Went there and order a set of ramen with ice cream and hot tea. Atmosphere is nice,family friendly. Staffs are nice and polite.

But there are few areas that I hope the restaurant could improve on:

1) the ramen soup was very salty. ( I don't know if it's my personal opinion, but this is the saltiest soup I've ever tasted.)

2) Dessert is served together with the food. By the time I've finished my ramen,my ice cream have already melted. ( From my experience dining in other restaurants, usually after u had finished your meal, then you request the staff for your dessert)

3) Hot tea is served in a porcelain cup, which make it too hot to even hold it. ( I could only able to drink it after it became cool tea üò≠)

If all the above can be improved,I don't mind coming again. If not, this might be my last time dining here again.","Went there and order a set of ramen with ice cream and hot tea. Atmosphere is nice,family friendly. Staffs are nice and polite.

25,Pixy Restaurant & Bar,2,"Had a good dining experience about two to three years ago during the Covid period. Came back to Pixy for the second time for dinner.

We ordered three dishes - bouillabaisse, grilled iberico pork collar and grilled squid, squid ink risotto. In general, the taste of the dishes is decent but we had some issues with the freshness and texture of the ingredients.

The bouillabaisse consist of two pieces of cuttlefish tentacles, one scallop, two prawns, three pieces of mackerel and some clams. Some of the ingredients wasn‚Äôt fresh and we highlighted it to the chef. He claimed that the prawns were frozen. The taste was definitely not sweet (menu indicated that it‚Äôs sweet prawn) and was mushy. The clams tasted bland, overcooked and soft. This dish is a chef‚Äôs recommendation but I definitely wouldn‚Äôt recommend it.

The taste of the grilled iberico pork collar was nice but it was at least 50% fat. Have tasted many iberico pork collar before but never this fat. The accompanying sides were decent.

The grilled squid was nicely done. However the risotto‚Äôs in the grilled squid was like a paste.

Overall the ambiance and service was nice but all the three dishes were underwhelming. It‚Äôs also unusual that a restaurant of that size has only one chef and one server on a Saturday evening.","Had a good dining experience about two to three years ago during the Covid period.

Whole restaurant only 3-5 people when i vist at around 4.35pm on 1jan2024.

The first thing the service staff tell me is no more food. Only left mutton bryani which is the food i wanted to eat.
He doesnt seem to be interested as i was not done with my order. I had to call him before he left after serving another family to follow up on my order.
And prior to my order he didnt even bother to give us a menu and insisted only left bryani and we had to ask for drinks menu to catch some of the drinks that are supposedly still available.

Food had 1 small hair on my yogurt! Can see in photo! Very hard to spot.

My wife had advised me not to visit as the review is bad and as a fan of indian food i couldn‚Äôt help myself but go against her advise.

Atmosphere at the cashier have a strong stench smell. The cashier girl only pass us the bank receipt at first, we had to ask for the food receipt then she give us.

394,Man Zhu Steamboat Restaurant,4,"Their food was as authentic as you could get in China. The crowd was also mostly Chinese nationals so again it says a lot about authenticity of this place.

Dishes were served in speedy fashion, the chefs were utterly brutal in their execution; dishing out item after items in record time. Please make a reservation prior to heading over. I overheard from the staff speaking to a walk-in customer that there‚Äôs 8 more names in the waiting list.

Have to drop one star because of the sanitary conditions of the place. As it‚Äôs a really small establishment, everything seems very cramped and a few times I have to walk like a crab just to get back to my table.

Floor was sticky at most areas and towards the back of the shop it was wet with grey most stains all over. Imagine a wet market walkway. You‚Äôll get the drift.

Probably the best way to enjoy this will be to order take out and eat in the comfort of your home if you‚Äôre picky with cleanliness.","Their food was as authentic as you could get in China. The crowd was also mostly Chinese nationals so again it says a lot about authenticity of this place.

653,Sol & Ora,5,"Sol & Ora

Located on a quiet level of The Outpost Hotel Sentosa, Sol & Ora is a Mediterranean cuisine restaurant with a Latin vibe.

What caught my attention were the Greek dishes on the menu. The only thing that came to my mind was Ouzo,  a dry anise-flavored aperitif that is widely consumed in Greece.

However, other than some of the Greek wines, I see no Ouzo. I tried my luck and asked the restaurant manager, who is a Russian-Greek, to offer me his private stash of Ouzo.

He explained that as there is only a small committee of Greeks in Singapore, not many restaurants or people will know such a spirit. Well, I'm sure glad that I asked.

Spirits aside, food and service were great. The restaurant manager was jovial and able to recommend wine pairing dishes.

The octopus dish is a must-order dish. The parma hams blended so well with the unsalted octopus and well grilled potatoes.

333,Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao,5,"Seeing the steak restaurant next door priced at 32.9 dollars, I immediately decided to dine at Crystal Jade.

A bowl of hot noodle soup must be the warmest treat for passengers traveling on planes or connecting flights. For diners who don't eat pork, you can order the beef brisket noodles and shrimp dumplings.

ü•©Beef Brisket Noodles
The soup base is reasonably rich, without any surprises, in a typical Chinese culinary style. The beef and brisket pieces are quite large, making it more satisfying than scallion oil noodles.

ü•©Shrimp Dumplings
These are large shrimp dumplings, following the Cantonese style. The dumplings are a bit dry, suitable for quick meals.

ü•©Bamboo Shoots
This seems to be a specialty side dish at Jade Kitchen, ordered by almost every table. However, it has a peculiar taste, with too much sugar, resulting in less saltiness. It's the kind of dish where you can feel a novice chef trying hard to cook, but no matter what, they can't achieve a consistent and flavorful seasoning. However, when eaten with the rich soup-based noodles, it creates a unique combination. It's a magical dish and a specialty of this restaurant. But at 8.8 bucks
the price seems a bit high, considering you get only a small portion of bamboo shoots, around 100g.

If you only eat the noodles, it might offer better value for money. Overall, it's not a disappointing choice.","Seeing the steak restaurant next door priced at 32.9 dollars, I immediately decided to dine at Crystal Jade.

904,Violet Oon @ Jewel,5,"Been here quite a few times. And the food is consistently good. Recommend the ayam buah keluak, beef rendang, dry laksa noodles. For kids, the nasi goreng (non spicy) is a good choice! I also enjoyed the pulut Hitam!

Service wise, nothing short of stellar. Every time I‚Äôm here, Ann gives good recommendations on food choices. However, today in particular, I brought the family (including a newborn baby) and Ann was particularly attentive and considerate to our needs. She even made special arrangements for my baby boy. Such staff should be recognized and I hope the management can note her performance accordingly!

Good food, family friendly. Highly recommend.","Been here quite a few times. And the food is consistently good. Recommend the ayam buah keluak, beef rendang, dry laksa noodles. For kids, the nasi goreng (non spicy) is a good choice! I also enjoyed the pulut Hitam!

Given the influx of authentic Japanese franchise in the island, the price tag is still stuck in the 90s (plus inflation). Well if you are in the area craving for decent Japanese food and is not willing to travel less than 10mins to orchard road, then this is the option for you. Set bentos for 2 person set you back at the average 70SGD . Overall is good quality but no wow factor .","This place serve decent Japanese food but the price is a little high .

209,BOMBAY DINING-NORTH INDIAN RESTAURANT,1,"Paneer shashlik tikka. The worst ever tikka I had in my life. No flavours at all. The chutney as can be seen in rhe photo too much color is added and not at all a tikka chutney by taste. The onions was stale. Had to throw away the whole dinner.

The chilli mushroom was so oily it took me a second glance to understand if it is dry or gravy.
The schezwan fried rice was full of added color. Pathetic flavour profile.

Had ordered paneer tikka masala few days before (pic not attached) , the color added stayed on the fingertips till the next day.

This restaurant is using way too much color in the food hence the pics look delicious. Perfect case of ""Don't judge the book by it's cover""!

Deliveroo is the delivery partner and as many have reviewed already they have zero say of your food is late. The restaurant phone number kept saying busy for 45mins at a stretch. Deliveroo said we cannot help you contact the restaurant and solve ot at your end!!!!!
