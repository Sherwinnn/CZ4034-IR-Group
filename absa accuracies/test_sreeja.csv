139,NAEUM Restaurant,4,"Thank you for making my first omakase experience at your restaurant so special! It was a belated birthday celebration with my best friend, and the entire afternoon was truly memorable.

The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. When I realized I couldn't eat the beef in the ""SO BBQ"" dish (the description only mentioned hanging tenderloin), they quickly offered a delicious fish alternative without any hesitation. I truly appreciate their understanding and willingness to ensure I had a wonderful dining experience. Perhaps adding small icons to the menu indicating the type of meat in each dish would be helpful for future diners, especially those with allergies or preferences. For non-Korean speakers, adding translations or clearer description could improve understanding.

The food was fantastic overall, with a variety of creative and flavourful dishes. The sauces were flavorful, but perhaps a touch too strong for some of the dishes, slightly masking the delicate taste of the main ingredient. I also absolutely loved their kombucha and hope they consider selling it in batches in the future!

Overall, I had a fantastic experience at your restaurant and would highly recommend it to others. The staff's attentiveness, the delicious food, and the unique omakase format combined for a truly memorable experience. Thank you once again!","Thank you for making my first omakase experience at your restaurant so special!

Experience not very good. I came here during lunch hour with colleagues. Food tasted very plain, shrimp not fresh, steam fish over cooked, soup over-powered by Chinese cooking wine taste. Most important of all - serving speed is extremely slow (we are just one of the 3 tables), and both our table and the table next to us are constantly asking them to speed up. We spent most of the time just waiting. Absolutely not suitable for business lunch.

- plenty of parking lots

- food taste need to be greatly improved

684,Osia Steak and Seafood Grill,2,"Cannot meaningfully recommend this. Below average experience. We ordered 3 Med rare ribeyes; one was burnt and sent back, the other was underdone (very rare) but we didn’t want to send back yet another steak. We ordered 2 lamb chops and sent back 1 for being burnt on the outside. Seafood platter (at 288) was poor; sauce was very one dimensional.

Service excellent and flatbread appetiser was good. Excellent service is the reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1.

This restaurant seems to cater to the patrons of rws instead of being a destination in itself. There are many better steakhouses at a similar price point in SG. The table behind us also complained about the seafood platter. That said, we were told the main chef was on leave the day we dined so perhaps our poor food was a one-off. However, at this price point, much more is expected.","Cannot meaningfully recommend this. Below average experience.

971,Tea House by Soup Restaurant - IMM,2,"This place is easily missable, walked one whole round of level 1 and didnt notice I passed by it... its ridiculous how its camouflaged by the other stores.

Not a conducive place to chat while eating as the waiters keep clanging the cutlery when keeping the dishes and the sound just reverbs throughout the restaurant.

Would like to comment how funny it was their soup bowl is even smaller than their rice bowl, which was already small enough, about the size of a petit woman's  palm. How do you expect people to drink from the bowls with ingredients in it?

White rice was so little, served in a small lil tiny bowl.
Ordered their 2 pax chicken set on the front of the menu thinking its their signature dish but the chicken and the cucumber are horrible. Not fresh and super dry. It was 35++ for that chicken and soup. Not worth it. Paid 77 for 2 pax for the whole dinner (included an extra tray of siew mai and fried fish)

At the end noticed people only come here for the dimsum. But there are better dimsums out there.","This place is easily missable, walked one whole round of level 1 and did not notice I passed by it... its ridiculous how its camouflaged by the other stores.

From the moment we first encountered the unique touch of Chef Zor Tan at Restaurant Andre, it was evident that a distinctive culinary voice was waiting to be fully expressed.

Every dish not only captivated our senses but also unveiled the depth of passion and innovation that underpins the chef's journey.

Born's ambiance masterfully intertwines a welcoming warmth with sophisticated elegance, a testament to their meticulous attention to detail. The impeccable service mirrors the very qualities of warmth, professionalism, and thoughtfulness that they exude.

828,Brotzeit German Beer Bar and Restaurant - VivoCity,4,"Indulge your cravings for authentic German cuisine at Brotzeit. The menu boasts an extensive array of dishes, my favorite is their rosti paired with crispy pork belly, complemented by a refreshing Kale salad. A family-friendly place, they accommodated our needs by providing space for our pram, catering to both a baby and a toddler. The venue offers both indoor and outdoor seating, affording a great view of the harbor. Children are well-catered with their kids menu.

I’m impressed with the cocktail selection, crafted to perfectly complement their German beer offerings. This haven has become our go-to spot for weekend lunch outings, and the added value of membership truly enhances the overall experience. I recommend this gem for its outstanding value, cleanliness of the restaurant and welcoming staff.","Indulge your cravings for authentic German cuisine at Brotzeit.

31,Legendary Hong Kong Restaurant @ Jurong Point 香港傳奇餐廳,1,"One of the worst dim sum I had for the price range. Cheong fun is the worse, skin is hard and I can only taste soy sauce. My boy even commented that it tasted like spring roll. Roast pork bun skin is thick with little meat. Lastly, chilli sauce is horrible. Only century egg congee is lightly better. Never order the rice bun shown in the picture. It is the worst of all. For the price, I would expect much higher standard. Disappointed.","One of the worst dim sum I had for the price range.

The staff  were all very helpful and kind. Rare to meet service staff like this nowadays. They also made food specially for allergy requirements of my daughter. 👍,I went there for the first time yesterday and liked the food and drinks especially the otak otak but what I think was good was how patient they were and never rush us or “show face “ while we celebrated birthday there till closing time.

959,Greenwood Fish Market,3,"Their fried food are quite good. However their sushi are not very fresh. Servers are very friendly. Another downside is that there are birds flying to the tables and kitchen where they prepare the food, making it quite unsanitary and the service crew seem unfazed by them. Weirdly, don’t see this issue at the neighbouring restaurants.

Aburi salmon maki - not very fresh, can skip

Fish and chip - they use catfish making it very soft and have the melt in the mouth effect. The batter they use for both the fries and fish are very crispy

Calamari - squid they use are very fresh and soft, batter is crispy and not sharp","Their fried food are quite good. However their sushi are not very fresh. Servers are very friendly.
