Often when it‚Äôs go time, people loses their composure and succumb to pressure. The men of Tambi operated smoothly and efficiently, making sure their guest feels comfortable. Certainly an underrated aspect of the restaurant.
A fusion of two different cuisine in extreme polarity come together unexpectedly well.
Personally my favourite is the Pajeon and the sweet tender ribs briyani.
Can‚Äôt say much about the other mains but overheard the customers beside us talking about the Lamb chops.
Definitely the next on the list!","Absolutely fantastic service and work etiquettes from the crew.

During my visit,¬† the restaurant was crowded,¬† though i must say they have a pretty decent system in place to usher in diners.

Surprisingly the queue moved fast and before long we were ushered to a seat by the window.

Order taking was quick and food was served in double quick time.

The food was only OK in my opinion although I must admit that the Vegetables in garlic sauce were good to eat and cooked well too.

I must certainly give credit to the staff and service crew who were quick and willing to serve.

Overall it was a Fast into the Restaurant and Fast out of the restaurant as well.¬† Pricing seemed really reasonable.

377,Element Restaurant Amara Singapore,1,"Came this evening (15/02/24) for a valentine date. Very disappointed in the food and service here. Initially saw it on TikTok when some influencer promoted it, it looked good there. Now I understand, maybe it was a paid promotion.

First of all, the atmosphere is not the best. Tables were placed very close to one another. When you walk in, it just doesn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre walking into a hotel standard buffet.

Then the service, the man at the sashimi bar was rude. When we ask for the sashimi, we are greeted with ‚Äúwhat you want?!‚Äù In a very rude manner and they way he communicates with the customers is not nice. However, the staffs were fast to clear our used plates on the table and were borderline friendly.

Last, the food. The sushi doesn‚Äôt taste very fresh and of good quality. Same can be said for their snow crab legs, it wasn‚Äôt as fresh. The meat was rather dry and tasteless. I did not eat any of the raw food as I‚Äôm allergic, therefore no comments on the sashimi, mussels.

The cooked food was below average. It includes the self serve rojak station, roast pork, roast chicken, ghor hiang, herbal duck, stir fry pork and grilled chicken.

The acceptable cook food that was pretty good was their fried bee Hoon & chicken satay. Those were pretty yummy.

The WORST dish there was the Chilli crab. Now I don‚Äôt expect Tzar Char standard but it wasn‚Äôt even close. The crabs were extremely small, the meat was so dark in colour and it breaks apart so easily. It felt like the crab was stored for a long time. It taste very very bad. The sauce was okay with the mantou.

Overall, I would not pay 98++ (dinner) for a buffet of this standard. Won‚Äôt be revisiting.","Came this evening (15/02/24) for a valentine date. Very disappointed in the food and service here.

110,Good Bites,4,"First time visiting there by chance! The reception area is good for taking Instagram pictures! Didn't have a reservation and arrived about lunch time but was greeted warmly and accommodated by the friendly staff!
While eating I noticed a pattern that is quite similar to Citrus by the pool and realized they both are the same company!
I loved the waffles and the portion of the ice cream was huge! I think the waiter gave me a different flavor instead of what I requested which I didn't even notice till my wife pointed it out! Guess I was too busy enjoying the waffle.
Their Cajun lamb chops need a slight improvement as it was a bit chewy but the flavour was good and the mashed potatoes were tasty!
For the price it's definitely worth it!

308,Ho√†ng H√¢u Vietnamese Restaurant,5,"Was looking for good food near SGH and found this place by chance. Would highly recommend to come here for a homely Vietnamese food. Below are my unbiased review:

The Lemongrass chicken skewers are really tasty, juicy and tender. The portion is also big.

Eel porridge is special and taste really nice and comfy especially in a rainy day.

Chicken Pho has a light broth that still encompass all the flavours. So if you prefer stronger taste, you might find it bland.

Fresh spring roll is fresh and good too, big in size! The sauce that comes with the spring roll is also unique and tasty.

Pork Bun Cha is a flavourful fish with fresh vegetables, sauce that is light with a tinge of sour, coupled with the pork meat patty that‚Äôs well flavoured (but a little hard for my taste).

The prawn crackers has light prawn taste and not oily, those who prefer lighter prawn taste will like this one.

For drinks, Vietnam coffee is a little light; the lemon grass is nice but is sweeten.

Service is very homely and they are Vietnamese who speaks chinese.

635,Numb Restaurant Â∑ùÈ∫ªËÆ∞,5,"We had:

Classic Chengdu Seabass in Sour Pickled Soup which was seasoned just nice for my taste - not overly sour with a hint of chilli.  I usually dislike seabass but this really changed my view.

Awesome Spicy Chilli Chicken (minus the Fried Dough Twist) which was aromatic with great spicy and numbing flavour.  The little bits of dried garlic in the dish was fragrant as well.

Sichuan Inspired Traditional Homemade Mapo Tofu was a little oily but it was surprisingly spicy.

Stir-fried Jack Beans with Red Chillis and Sichuan Pickles is usually a hit-or-miss dish. Most restaurants fail to remove the fibrous seams but here they have done really well. Each stalk was plump and full of flavour.

Osmanthus Fermented Wine with Rice Balls was a sweet ending to the savoury dinner.  It's good if you have a sweet tooth.

The only thing that wasn't ideal was the plain rice which was probably pre-scooped as the top layer had already dried and hardened.","We had:

The usage of charcoal grill was a plus point as it provided the immense heat and smoke that had added the charbroiled, smoky taste into the food that gives barbecued meats their unforgettable flavor.

Occasionally, the sudden blazing fire from the charcoal added the extra fun experience.

482,Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata Restaurant in Singapore,4,"4 stars for the food not for the SERVICE! Pricing wise it‚Äôs acceptable and food is great but service wise they need to reorganise their worker and work flow.
Firstly, waiting time for food is so long not saying it‚Äôs a weekend or weekday other tables that are later than us got their food first and when we went to double check on our food their worker replied ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a queue so must wait‚Äù okay fine we wait so 10-15 mins later the food is not here yet so went to check again and told them our table have yet to have any items on the table they seems to be suspicious about us not telling the truth so we have to went back and forth many times just to check on our food order.
Secondly, I saw they put some food items onto their metal trolley which belongs to our table okay so we assume they were preparing our food but they didn‚Äôt! They left the food there and serve other tables food first while leaving those sides on the metal trolley!
Thirdly, after such a long long long time we finally get our food and guess what the person came to ask us to pay for our food. Wow we wait for our food for that long and you want us to pay our bill plus on a side note they miss out some of the items that were on the list.
Fourthly, there will be a lady incharge of billing and she will bring it to the cashier. So apparently this happen we told the lady that some items were missing and pass her a $50 together with the bill and she said she will come back with the change but ended up the lady came back claiming that we did not pass her the $50 but we did! Then next, one of her co-worker wearing a sarong top came and said ‚Äúyou guys said you pay the money but where‚Äôs the money‚Äù umm hello lady how the heck will i know where the money went we definitely did gave your co-worker the money for our meal!!! She claimed that there is 4 person working so which is the lady that we pass the money to? Umm i only see like 1 lady working throughout the entire shift tell me where is the other 3?
Lastly, the lady who took the $50 drank alcohol with her friends. Wow mind-blown man clap for this place‚Äôs mookata can work and drink at the same time.
Okay folks that‚Äôs it for the review of this place go ahead and try and see what experience you will get

Absolutely yes!

This is an outstanding culinary experience not to be missed. First and foremost, the food is world class. Certainly one of the strongest 3 Michelin star menus I have had in recent times. All dishes were complex and multi-layered in their sensations, yet utterly delicious.

I also really enjoyed the flow of the dinner, starting at the ground floor with some excellent choice of bubbles, first nibbles and the now iconic showcase of ingredients, before moving on to the main dining room.

The wine list seemed well curated. Apart from the obvious super high end choices there was a decent range of more modest options. We had a Savagnin from Jura and a bottle of German Sp√§tburgunder, both excellent and great value.
